# Chapter 2, 3, 4 Image Generation Prompts

Here are several visual prompts you can use to generate the most cinematic, amazing scenes from the latest heist chapters.

## Chapter 2: The Street of Dead Bells

### Scene 1: The Sleeper Revealed
**Context:** Maks reveals his true nature to Kito in the dark apartment.
**Prompt:**
> Epic anime sci-fi/dieselpunk style. A tense, dramatic scene inside a cramped, pitch-black antiquary shop. On the left, a terrified pursang (cat-hybrid humanoid with yellow slit eyes and spectacles) cowers against a desk. On the right stands a tall, intimidating man in a dark trenchcoat. He has just taken off his sunglasses. His eye sockets are filled with swirling, absolute black dust (pure darkness). In the background corner, a woman lies on a bed, her arm slowly turning into glowing, translucent purple crystal. Heavy shadows, high contrast, claustrophobic and terrifying atmosphere.

### Scene 2: The Artillery Dash
**Context:** The crew escapes Kito's apartment and runs through the bombarded street towards the slaughterhouse sewer grate. Maks slices the grate with his nanobots.
**Prompt:**
> Epic anime sci-fi/dieselpunk style. A chaotic street scene at night under heavy artillery bombardment. Explosions ring out, throwing debris and black smoke into the air. In the foreground, a tall man in a dark trench coat (Maks) effortlessly slices a massive iron sewer grate into perfect cubes using a swarm of invisible nanobots. Beside him, a fierce fox-girl (Tami) with turquoise eyes and a drawn rapier dives into the dark sewer opening, followed by a cowering pursang librarian (Kito) carrying a tube of maps. A massive grey wolf jumps down with them. Explosions illuminate the background in fierce oranges and reds.

## Chapter 3: Under the City

### Scene 1: The Pressure Chamber Fight
**Context:** The team is ambushed by three mutated Spira experiments (a bear, a kunami, and a wolf) in the old geothermal ventilation room.
**Prompt:**
> Epic anime sci-fi/dieselpunk style. A massive, flooded underground industrial ventilation chamber with a giant rusted turbine in the background. A dense cloud of white, boiling steam fills half the room. From the steam emerges a horrifying mutated half-bear creature with five eyes on stalks and glowing purple crystals growing from its skin. In the foreground, a tall man in a trench coat (Maks) calmly fires a heavy black submachine gun at the beast. Beside him, a fiercely determined fox-girl (Tami) stands in knee-deep toxic water, her left hand projecting a glowing yellow magical glyf shield, while her right hand holds a slender rapier pointed forward. Dynamic action, dramatic mechanical ruins.

### Scene 2: Yera's Healing Grace
**Context:** Tami finds Yera in the dungeon. Yera, despite her captivity, immediately stops to heal the young Mezra guard that Tami just stabbed.
**Prompt:**
> Epic anime sci-fi/dieselpunk style. A dark, wet, medieval-looking dungeon corridor lit by a single sputtering oil lamp. In the center, a beautiful cat-girl (Yera) with dark hair, black cat ears, and exhausted, hollow blue eyes kneels on the stone floor. She wears a heavily oversized, dirty grey monk's robe. Despite her fragile state, she has her hands pressed against the bleeding chest of a young unconscious guard. Brilliant, flowing, water-like blue light (Spira magic) pours from her hands and a glowing blue glyf, illuminating the dark corridor and her exhausted face. Standing over her in shock is a fox-girl (Tami) holding a bloody rapier. Deeply emotional, contrasting light and dark.

## Chapter 4: Elania's Blade

### Scene 1: The Assassin's Strike
**Context:** Sera completely bypasses Rau's shield and kills him with her glowing Yari. 
**Prompt:**
> Epic anime sci-fi/dieselpunk style. A brutal assassination in a dark, flooded subterranean stone vault. A massive, two-meter-tall gorilla-like super-soldier (Rau) in bulky crimson power armor with a glowing blue hard-light energy shield on his back is suddenly struck from behind. The assassin is a tall, unnervingly beautiful woman (Sera) with long black hair, dead black eyes, and skin that seems to absorb light (black nanotech camouflage). She is driving a traditional Japanese spear (Yari) with a blindingly bright, glowing purple energy blade cleanly through the soldier's energy shield and heavy armor, piercing his spine. Dynamic composition, shocking and visceral.
**References:**
- Sera: `[Sera Reference](../../../../assets/characters/Sera/sera_reference.png)` (If available, or follow the dark assassin description)
- Rau (Armor): Like the image we tried to generate earlier (Crusader No Remorse style armor, crimson with brass).

### Scene 2: The Fall of the Mother's Temple
**Context:** The Paladins' self-destruct mechanism brings down the massive temple above them. 
**Prompt:**
> Epic anime sci-fi/dieselpunk style. A wide, apocalyptic view of a sprawling, heavily industrialized dieselpunk city at night, under bombardment. In the very center of the city, a colossal, ancient white cathedral-like temple is collapsing into a massive sinkhole. The temple features a towering spire topped with a giant, glowing purple crystal. The spire is currently tilting drastically, the crystal shattering and raining glowing purple shards down onto the panicked streets below. Plumes of dust and fire rise into the night sky as the entire foundational structure caves in. Epic scale, tragic destruction.
