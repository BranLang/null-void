# Geography of Planet Achilles (Kepler-452b)

> *"Winter, heavy gravity, and the shadows of ancient gods."*

## Planetary Data

| | |
|---|---|
| **Original name** | Kepler-452b ("Earth 2.0") |
| **Distance** | 1,400 light-years (Cygnus constellation) |
| **Size** | Super-Earth (1.6x Earth's radius) |
| **Gravity** | **High** (approx. 2x Earth) |
| **Orbit** | 385 days (similar year) |
| **Sun** | G2 (similar to ours, slightly older) |

### Effect of Gravity on Humans
With double the gravity, humans had to adapt (both biologically and with nanodrone assistance):
- **Build:** Shorter, stockier, but **extremely muscular**.
- **Movement:** They appear heavy-footed, but possess tremendous strength.
- **Birds:** Flight is difficult, but possible thanks to the denser atmosphere.

---

## Climate and Environment

The planet underwent partial terraforming (Inetis and nanodrones), but most of the surface remained inhospitable.

### General Climate — A Frozen World
- **Nearly the entire planet is frozen.** Achilles is an ice world — the surface is almost completely covered in ice, snow, and permafrost.
- **The only habitable zone** is a narrow belt around the **equator**, where a combination of solar radiation, geothermal activity, and residual terraforming maintains temperatures above freezing.
- This equatorial belt is **all that Varietas civilization knows** — the rest of the planet is their "White Edge of the World." The three discovered continents — Terra, Simira, and Neuropa — lie within this belt.
- The belt is no tropical paradise — it's a harsh, cold landscape of boreal forests, tundra, and occasional warmer valleys. Jungles exist only in the equatorial core (geothermal springs + terraforming remnants).

### Seasonal Cycle
- **Winters last 5 years** — devastating for agriculture. Even in the equatorial belt, temperatures drop to near freezing; glaciers advance closer.
- **Varietas age measurement**: Counted in winters survived (e.g., "She's 12 winters old" = ~60 years)
- **Long summers**: Periods of abundance when nations stockpile for the next winter. The equatorial belt expands; some areas become temporarily habitable.
- **Cause of conflicts**: Poor planning of summer stockpiles leads to famine and war. During winters, the habitable belt shrinks and nations fight over space.

#### Celestial Mechanics and Maps
- **Infera (ARK-13)**: On the night sky (and sometimes during the day), a bright, unnatural "star" is visible to the naked eye. They call it **Infera**.
    - **Cultural Schism**: The sight of Infera divides the world.
        - **Nevriss and Beladiss (Religious)**: Perceive it as **"The Devil's Eye."** Superstitious villagers hide indoors and believe one must never look at it. In cities, this custom is already considered outdated and superstitious.
        - **Graw and Kito (Pragmatists)**: Preserved old knowledge (or intuition) — they know Infera is a **ship**. For them, it's a reminder of technology, not Spira.
- **Tomb of Giants (Ocean)**: ARK-11 and ARK-12 crashed into the ocean after losing Inetis (gravity was too strong for stable orbit without corrections). Their wrecks lie in the deep.
- **Ancient Maps (Winter/Summer)**: Preserved planetary maps show the world's state from when ships still orbited (shortly after AY 0). They depict a world that was different then (e.g., Terra didn't yet have forests).

#### Seasonal Changes (visible on ancient maps)

**In summer:**
- Ice caps recede — the habitable belt is at its widest.
- Graw (north) is entirely green — dense forests, vegetation, agriculture thrives.
- Terra is alive and fertile from north to south.
- The sea is open — maritime trade routes are free, islands accessible.
- Even areas far from the equator become temporarily habitable.

**In winter:**
- Ice caps expand dramatically — from above and below.
- **Graw is nearly swallowed by ice.** Northern forests are covered in snow and ice crust. Only the magma-heated city survives. Most of Graw's territory becomes uninhabitable — settlements and villages in the forests empty out; inhabitants retreat to the magma city.
- The habitable belt shrinks to a narrow strip around the equator.
- The sea partially freezes — maritime routes are restricted or impossible. Ice floes block the coast.
- Nevriss survives better — closer to the equator, milder conditions — but even here temperatures drop and harvests decline.
- **Ynetis (archipelago at the equator) stays green** — the warmest place on the planet, protected by its position. Paradoxically, the most habitable place on the planet is flooded with Wraiths and unreachable. Most Varietas believe it sank.
- Neuropa (deserts, mountains) — desert areas shrink, mountain regions freeze.

**This is the key to war:** Graw loses most of its territory in winter. A five-year winter literally freezes the land — magma heats the city but doesn't feed it. Graw starves while Nevriss near the equator can still produce grain. That's why Graw always eventually attacks the south.

### Seismic Activity — A Living Planet

Achilles's core is extremely active. Unlike Earth, where tectonic activity is distributed across large areas, on Achilles the core's energy concentrates in the equatorial belt — exactly where people live.

- **Earthquakes** are fairly frequent — minor tremors several times monthly, stronger ones several times yearly. Architecture has adapted: low buildings, massive foundations, flexible structures. Despite this, every strong earthquake leaves damage.
- **Tsunami** devastate coastal areas several times per decade. Enormous waves triggered by submarine earthquakes destroy ports, ships, and coastal settlements. That's why **airships are preferred over ships** — they're above the water, above the waves, above destruction.
- **Geysers and hot springs** are ubiquitous. Civilization uses them as energy sources — underground steam powers machines, heats cities, and warms water.
- **Magma chambers** lie close to the surface in many locations — Graw is the most prominent example (entire city heated by magma), but Nevriss also has geothermal zones.
- **Volcanic activity**: Occasional eruptions of smaller volcanoes in mountain regions. Mostly predictable (Maki can read earth vibrations), but sometimes catastrophic.

> **Consequence for civilization:** Maritime trade exists (it's cheaper than air travel), but it's considered dangerous and unreliable. Ships sink, ports are destroyed, coastal cities are regularly flooded. Most long-distance trade and travel therefore takes place by airship.

### Equatorial Belt (The Only Habitable Zone)
- **Width:** A narrow band above and below the equator — everything else is ice.
- **Climate:** Mild to cold. Warmer valleys near geothermal springs. In summer, reminiscent of Central European weather; in winter, Arctic.
- **Fauna:** Genetically modified animals (dangerous), adapted to cold. Large predators (wolves, bears) roam the dense forests — genetic mutations from the terraforming era.
- **Ynetis:** Lost city — legends say it sank. In reality, it stands on an archipelago at the equator beyond the sea, but is flooded with Wraiths and unreachable. No expedition has returned.
- **All kingdoms** (Graw, Nevriss, and others) are located within this belt on Terra.

### Beyond the Equator — The Dead Zone
- **Endless ice.** No life, no civilization.
- Temperatures far below zero year-round.
- Occasional expeditions venture into the icy wastes for rare minerals, but most never return.
- Legends speak of "cities under the ice" — remnants of failed colonies from the Golden Age.

## Continents

Three main continents lie in the equatorial belt. Each race knows them by different names.

| Continent | Name | Original form | Origin |
|-----------|------|---------------|--------|
| **Main** | **Terra** | **Terra Nova** | The first Varietas colonists couldn't agree on a name for their new home. They ultimately chose the simplest solution — an ancient word from a dead language: *Terra Nova* ("New Earth"). It gradually shortened to **Terra**. Nevriss is just one of ~20 countries on Terra. |
| **Southern** | **Simira** | **Simian + Mira** | The Apes spoke English, and their first leader — whom they began calling **Caesar** after a legendary film — invented the name by combining *Simian* (ape, lat.) + *Mira* (peace/wonder). It was meant to be a dignified name for their new home — a continent where primates would finally find peace. And "Caesar" became a hereditary title — every ruler of the Apes bears the title **Caesar**. An internal meme that survived 3,000 years. |
| **Western** | **Neuropa** | **Neo Europa** | A nostalgic reference to old Europe — the continent that human ancestors left behind. Originally *Neo Europa*, gradually shortened to **Neuropa**. Humans remember Earth — unlike Varietas and Apes, several hundred original Earthlings still live and speak the old language. |

### Languages by Continent

| Continent | Language | Note |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Terra** | **Varietas language** | Evolution of English mixed with animal sounds. Completely unintelligible to other races. Script inspired by Hiragana. |
| **Simira** | **English (old)** | Apes preserved English — their language is closer to the original than anything on Terra. Caesar and the first leaders spoke fluent English. After 3,000 years it evolved, but the base remains recognizable. |
| **Neuropa** | **English + slangs** | Several hundred immortal Earthlings speak original English (old language). But over 3,000 years, **multiple slangs and sub-languages** evolved in Neuropa — each city, tribe, or community has its own variation. The base is recognizable, but dialects vary. |

> **Note:** Varietas from Nevriss mainly know their own continent — Terra. About Simira and Neuropa, they know only from legends and sailors' tales. Apes and Humans have their own names, which Varietas don't know or use.

## Political Geography of Terra (Main Continent)

### Description from the Map

Terra occupies the northwestern part of the habitable belt. It stretches from north to south. The ocean with glaciers and small islands borders it to the west; more islands and unexplored lands lie to the east. Approximately **20 different countries** exist on Terra — Graw and Nevriss are merely the two largest and most influential.

## Northern Kingdom: GRAW

| | |
|---|---|
| **Name** | **Graw** |
| **Old name** | Unknown (lost to history) |
| **Ruler** | "Immortal **Grond**" |
| **Religion** | Cult of the Immortal Grond |
| **Character** | Militant, expansionist, industrial |
| **Capital** | Magma City (beneath a mountain massif) |
| **Population** | **Humans** (ruling caste / army) + Varietas (workers / slaves). Unlike the South, Graw has a significant population of "Pure" humans who form the army's core. |

### Graw Capital — Magma City

Graw's capital lies beneath a massive mountain range at the northern edge of the habitable belt. The city is built over a system of geothermal springs and magma chambers that heat it — without this warmth, it would be uninhabitable.

- **Magma heating**: The entire city is built above active magma chambers. Stone channels carry hot water and steam from underground into buildings, streets, and fortifications. The red-orange glow of magma is visible even from afar — the city shines in the dark winter landscape like an enormous glowing ember.
- **Eternal winter**: Relentless winter rages around the city. Dense coniferous forests cover the land but are buried in snow. Without magma heat, the city would fall during the first five-year winter.
- **Architectural contrast**: Thick stone walls, iron gates, and mining towers — an industrial fortress. Chimneys belch steam from sulfur springs. Streets are warm from underground heat, but the air reeks of sulfur.
- **Strategic importance**: Whoever controls the magma controls Graw. The city is nearly impregnable — access only through narrow passes or by air.
- **Visible on the map**: Glowing red-orange light above the city, mountain massif behind it, coniferous forests on the sides, snow and ice everywhere.

### Graw Landscape

- **Forests**: Dense, dark coniferous forests cover most of the territory. Dangerous fauna — mutated beasts, wolf packs the size of horses.
- **Mining**: Mines in the mountains — iron, rare metals, sulfur. Industrial economy powered by geothermal steam.
- **Villages**: Scattered settlements in the forests, supplied from the capital. During winters, many are abandoned.
- **Northern border**: Beyond the mountain massif begins the frozen zone. Occasional expeditions for rare minerals.

### The Secret of Grond
- **True Grond (AY 700–1200)**: An actual Archangel, Ex Inferis from Earth. A just ruler who wore Power Armor. The Varietas loved him.
- **Death (~AY 1200)**: Died of Glitch Rot. His Power Armor remained.
- **Dynasty of impostors (AY 1200–3013)**: Generals donned the armor and declared themselves "Grond II, III..." No one sees the face beneath the helmet.
- **Current "Grond"**: An aggressor and conqueror. Starting a war with the South.

### Grond's Appearance — the original legend
- Like The Rock in The Scorpion King / Conan
- Muscular, rugged, an adventurer of "old blood"
- Power Armor = a walking tank, symbol of divine power

### Cause of War (AY ~3013)
- **5-year winter**: Devastated the North's supplies — magma heats the city but doesn't feed it
- **Poor planning**: Food shortage, terrain too cold for agriculture
- **Trade refusal**: Nevriss refuses to trade with "unbelievers"
- **Solution**: Military expansion southward — through the Hangravall passes by land and air

---

## Southern Land: NEVRISS

| | |
|---|---|
| **Old name** | **Neverice** (Never-Ice = "never ice") |
| **Varietas name** | **Nevriss** (with a hiss at the end) |
| **Size** | Approximately the size of Italy |
| **Capital** | **Nevriss City** (southern coast, on cliffs) |
| **Border city** | **Shoraven** (northern border, near Graw) |
| **Government** | Council of High Priestesses (matriarchy) |
| **Religion** | Cult of the All-Knowing Mother |
| **Character** | Mercantile, more liberal, theocratic |

### Nevriss Landscape (from the map)

Nevriss occupies the central and southern part of Terra — from Hangravall in the north to the seacoast in the south. It is the most fertile and most densely populated land on the planet.

- **Forests**: Dense deciduous and mixed forests cover the interior. Greener and warmer than Graw's conifers. Full of wildlife — wolves, bears, mutated predators from the terraforming era.
- **Rivers**: At least two major rivers flow from Hangravall south toward the sea. They form the main commercial and transport arteries — cargo barges and river steamers travel them.
- **Valleys and plains**: Between forests and rivers, fertile fields — wheat, grain, orchards. The most important agricultural areas on the planet.
- **Smaller cities and villages**: Scattered along rivers and trade routes. Visible on the map as fortified settlements with towers.
- **Coast**: Irregular, with small islands, bays, and rocky outcrops. Lighthouses on headlands shine for ships.
- **Southern coast**: Never freezes — warm currents from the equator keep the water liquid year-round. This enabled maritime transport even during the Long Winters and was the foundation of Nevriss's naval expansion.
- **Western coast**: Glaciers and frozen islands — proximity to the frozen zone. Trade routes skirt ice floes.

### History of Nevriss — Rise and Fall of a Naval Empire

Nevriss wasn't always just one kingdom on Terra. It was once an **empire** — the greatest power planet Achilles had ever seen.

#### The Golden Age of Spira (~AY 800 – ~AY 1500)
After Inetis gave the Varietas the **Gift of the Mother** and the great battle with the humans (Archangels) ended, a golden age dawned in Terra's south. Nevriss was the first kingdom to fully harness Spira's potential — not for war, but for **building**.

- **Naval expansion**: Nevriss ships spread along Terra's southern shores. The southern coast never freezes — warm equatorial currents keep the sea open year-round, enabling maritime transport even during the Long Winters. Ships sailed from port to port, founding colonies and trading posts.
- **Colonization**: Nevriss ships established dozens of cities and settlements along the coast. They brought **language, culture, religion (Cult of the Mother)**, and a way of life. Many of today's nations in southern Terra have Nevriss roots.
- **Terraforming with Spira**: Colonists planted trees and **terraformed the landscape using Spira** — transforming inhospitable coastlines into fertile soil. The forests that cover Nevriss's interior and surrounding nations today are largely the work of this era.
- **Trade network**: An extensive network of maritime trade routes emerged — spices, grain, metals, Spira crystals traveled by sea between dozens of ports. Nevriss became the center of trade for the entire southern world.

#### The Great Flood (~AY 1500 – ~AY 1600)
The empire fell not under the weight of war, but **under the waves**.

- **Catastrophic tsunami**: A series of massive submarine earthquakes triggered devastating waves that struck the entire southern coast of Terra. Many port cities and colonies were destroyed or completely submerged.
- **Nevriss City survived**: The city on its high cliffs withstood — tsunami broke against the rocks below. But the **fleet was destroyed** — ships in the port below the cliffs were swept away, docks and shipyards damaged.
- **Loss of colonies**: Lower-lying port cities and colonies along the coast were destroyed or completely submerged. Many vanished forever.
- **Imperial fragmentation**: Colonies lost contact with the center. Without ships and ports, trade routes were severed. Distant settlements became independent or perished. From one empire arose today's independent nations of southern Terra.
- **Loss of naval supremacy**: Nevriss lost its fleet and with it control over trade routes. The city itself survived, but the empire was gone.

#### The Airship Era (post AY 2212, arrival of Maki)
After the arrival of the **Maki** (androids from the ship Hephaestus, AY 2212), the situation changed.

- **Airships**: Maki brought the technical knowledge that enabled airship construction. These quickly became the **primary form of long-distance transport** — safer than ships, above the reach of tsunami and earthquakes.
- **Ships still exist**: Maritime trade didn't disappear entirely — ships are a **cheaper** but **riskier** alternative. Used by those who can't afford airships, or smugglers who don't want to be seen from above.
- **Imperial legacy**: Nevriss language, the Cult of the Mother, and culture survived in many nations of southern Terra — traces of the former empire are still everywhere.

### Border City: SHORAVEN

| | |
|---|---|
| **Old name** | **Shorehaven** (Shore-Haven = "port refuge") |
| **Varietas name** | **Shoraven** |
| **Location** | Northern border of Nevriss — strategic port on the border with Graw |
| **Character** | Military-commercial hub, frontline, multicultural borderland |
| **Landmark** | Main Temple of the All-Knowing Mother (branch from Nevriss City) |
| **Economy** | Guild system, military supply chain, exchange (Shobo) |
| **Current status** | 3rd year of continuous winter (Long Winter) — city under threat of Graw invasion |

#### Northern Border — Shoraven (from the map)

Shoraven lies on the northern border of Nevriss, in a strategic position separating Nevriss civilization from Graw's northern territories. The city is the South's last bastion before the wild North — whoever holds Shoraven controls the mountain passes and northern access to Nevriss.

- **Position**: Northern border of Nevriss, just below the Hangravall mountain range. The city stands on a rocky coast by the northern sea. Mountains on one side, cold sea on the other.
- **Port**: A large northern port — docks, cranes, warehouses, ship workshops. The port **isn't completely frozen** — thermal currents from submarine geothermal springs keep the bay water liquid even when the surrounding ocean freezes. This makes Shoraven strategically invaluable — the only functional northern port during the Long Winter.
- **Lighthouses**: Stone lighthouses stand on coastal headlands around the city — navigation points for ships and airships arriving from the north.
- **Defensive position**: A natural fortress — mountains and passes to the north, a road inland to the south. The city is fortified — massive walls, defensive towers, military garrison. First line of defense against Graw.
- **Long Winter (3rd year)**: Shoraven is enduring its third year of continuous winter. Streets buried in snow, buildings coated in frost. Supplies are dwindling. Civilian population gradually evacuated south to Nevriss City. Remaining: soldiers, merchants, and those with nowhere to go.
- **Invasion threat**: Graw's army is massing beyond the passes. Shoraven is the first city to fall if Graw attacks — and everyone knows it.
- **Surroundings**: Beyond the city to the south stretch forests and agricultural land. Roads lead south to Nevriss City and smaller towns. To the north, only passes and Graw territory.

#### Trade and Guilds
- **Shobo (Exchange)**: Open market in the port center — commodities, metals, grain, spices, Spira crystals. Significantly reduced during the Long Winter — mainly military supplies.
- **Guild halls**: Each guild (Smiths, Merchants, Aeronauts, Clockmakers...) has its own hall and council. Many guilds relocated their headquarters to Nevriss City — only border branches remain in Shoraven.
- **Free trade**: Unlike Graw (where the state controls commerce), here everyone trades — but the range has narrowed to weapons, food, and fuel.
- **Dual power**: The Church rules the spirit, guilds rule the money — but in wartime, military authority prevails.
- **Black market**: Underground trade in relics, forbidden weapons, and tunnel maps. Smuggling across the border with the North flourishes.

#### Maritime Trade Routes
- Shoraven is the key northern port — the only one where the sea doesn't freeze thanks to thermal currents.
- **Southward (along the coast)**: Supply routes to Nevriss City and smaller ports. The city's main supply artery.
- **Northward**: Once trade routes to Graw ports — now closed due to conflict.
- **Imports**: Military supplies and grain from the south (ship convoys), weapons from guild smiths, occasional smuggled goods from the north.

#### Role in the Story
- **Opening scene**: An airship arrives at the nighttime city at dock 17 — on the very edge of the port, in a snow-covered border city under the threat of war
- **Heist location**: The Antenna hidden in the vaults beneath the Main Temple — a remote border branch of the temple, less guarded than the central one in Nevriss City
- **Siege**: During the war with Graw, Shoraven will be the first city to face attack — through the passes and by air. The fall of Shoraven opens the road to the heart of Nevriss.

### Capital: NEVRISS CITY

| | |
|---|---|
| **Old name** | **Neverice City** (shortened from the original settlement) |
| **Varietas name** | **Nevriss City** |
| **Location** | Southern coast of Nevriss — a city on high cliffs above the sea |
| **Character** | Political, religious, and commercial center of the nation |
| **Landmarks** | **The Great Lighthouse** (3D-printed communication antenna, city symbol) + Main Temple of the All-Knowing Mother |
| **Economy** | Guild headquarters, central exchange, port (elevator system) |

#### Location and Description

Nevriss City is the capital and heart of all Nevriss. It sits on the southern coast, on **high cliffs** above the sea. The city survived the **Great Flood** (~AY 1500) precisely thanks to its position — tsunami broke against the massive cliffs below, but the fleet in port was destroyed. While lower-lying port cities and colonies vanished beneath the waves, Nevriss City remained standing and became the sole center of power for the fragmented empire.

- **Position**: A city on high cliffs above the southern sea. Descent to ships and port via a **massive elevator system and tunnels carved into the rock** — an imposing feat of engineering connecting the upper city with the docks at sea level. A strategically safe position — an attacker would first have to overcome Shoraven and all of northern Nevriss, or land beneath the cliffs.
- **Port**: Below the cliffs lies the port complex — docks, warehouses, shipyards. Access only via elevators and tunnels in the rock. The southern coast never freezes, so the port operates year-round.
- **The Great Lighthouse**: An enormous lighthouse on the cliff's edge — **a symbol of Nevriss City for thousands of years**. Originally served as a **communication antenna**, **3D-printed** from nanodrones during the Golden Age. Today, Varietas perceive it only as a majestic lighthouse and city symbol. Its true origin (3D printing, communication technology) is forgotten — for the inhabitants, it's an ancient structure as old as the city itself.
  - **Story role (Triangulation)**: Maks activates the Antenna here and uses the Lighthouse as the **first point of trigonometric triangulation** to find the lost city Ynetis. For the precise calculation, he needs three high points by the sea — the Great Lighthouse in Nevriss, **the Glass Tower** at Zaya's, and **the Tower of the Damned** at Elania's.
- **Temple**: Main Temple of the All-Knowing Mother — the largest and most lavish on the entire continent. Seat of the Council of High Priestesses. Golden domes visible from the sea and the interior.
- **Guild headquarters**: All major guilds (Smiths, Merchants, Aeronauts, Clockmakers...) have central halls in Nevriss City. This is where laws are passed, contracts signed, and the economy decided.
- **Defensive position**: The cliffs are a natural fortress from the south — sea and rocks are insurmountable. From the north, walls and distance from the front protect the city. The city relies on Shoraven and northern fortresses to hold the enemy.
- **Population**: The largest city on the continent — merchants, priestesses, craftspeople, nobility, refugees from the north. During the Long Winter, population grows — evacuees from the border regions move here.
- **Atmosphere**: Unlike harsh Shoraven, Nevriss City is more civilized, warmer (thanks to its southern position), and wealthier. Streets are paved, markets full, temples lit. From the cliff's edge, the view stretches over an endless sea. But beneath the surface, tension builds — news from the front grows worse.
- **The Blessed Mother (Secret)**: On the throne in the Main Temple sits the **Blessed Mother** — the highest priestess, head of the Council of High Priestesses, a revered and merciful leader. The public perceives the Blessed Mother as a **lineage of holy women** — every ~100 years, the departing Mother selects a young maiden from the people and behind closed doors "passes on the blessing." In reality, this is **Mormiel** — the 4th Archangel from ARK-13, who disassembles the candidate with nanotechnology, absorbs her, and takes on her appearance. The "new Mother" then confirms that the old Mother transformed into light and was called by Inetis. Over ~2,300 years, she has passed through ~23 identities. At night, she hunts the city streets as a predator — the urban legend of the **"Night Shadow"** is actually her. Details in [characters/Mormiel.md](characters/Mormiel.md).

## Eastern Land: BELADISS

| | |
|---|---|
| **Name** | **Beladiss** (Bella-Dis = "Beautiful Isis") |
| **Location** | East of Nevriss, along the coast |
| **Government** | Theocratic monarchy (Matriarchy) |
| **Religion** | Orthodox Cult of the Mother (Dualism) |
| **Character** | Conservative, mystical, oppressive toward men |

### Landscape and Society
Beladiss is a land of white cliffs, windswept plains, and ancient monasteries. Unlike industrial Graw or mercantile Nevriss, Beladiss is a country of "pure faith."

- **Theology of Hatred**: They believe in duality. The Mother (Inetis) is good; the Father (sometimes identified with the Sleeper) is evil. Men are considered bearers of the "Sin of the Father." They have limited rights, cannot inherit land, and serve in the army as "penitents" (frontline, suicide missions).
- **Relationship with Nevriss**: Beladiss and Nevriss are theoretically allies (they worship the same goddess), but in practice distrust each other. For Beladiss, Nevriss is a "nest of debauchery" where men have too much freedom.
- **Lore**: In their mythology, there's a story about "the Daughter who had to kill the Father to save the world." This story is a distorted version of the true history of Inetis and John Reef.

## Mountain Range: HANGRAVALL / ATRA (The Hunger Walls)

A massive mountain range separating North from South. For the North, it's a wall that traps them in winter. For the South, it's the protective backbone of the Mother.

| Perspective | Name | Meaning | Original expression (Etymology) |
|-------------|------|---------|--------------------------------|
| **Southerners** | **Atra** | "Mother's Backbone" | *Moth-Ra* (Mother's Range) → *Matra* → **Atra** |
| **Northerners** | **Hangravall** | "Hunger Walls" — a wall separating them from warmth, sea, and food. A natural prison. | *Hunger Wall* → *Hung-Val* → **Hangravall** |

> **Language Barrier:** The mountains are so impassable that the languages of North and South evolved differently over 2,000 years. Both derive from English (Old Speech), but are mutually unintelligible.
> - **Southerner (Nevriss):** Speaks melodically, softly. The language is heavily influenced by **purring and feline nuances** (elongated vowels, purring when content), since feline species dominate the population.
> - **Northerner (Graw):** Speaks gutturally, clipped, hard.
>
> *Example:* "Give me water."
> - South: *"Gimmau ota..."* (Give me water) — *spoken softly, almost like a meow*
> - North: *"Gi-woda!"* (Give water) — *a bark*
>
> **Nevriss Demographics:**
> - **70% Feline** (Cats, Pumas, Tigers, Lions)
> - **20% Canis/Lupus** (Dogs, Wolves — mostly immigrants or border folk)
> - **10% Other** (Bears, Otters, Reptiles...)
> - **Maki (Androids):** Exactly **5** functional Maki live in all of Nevriss. They are rarer than Archangels.

- **Passes**: Strategically crucial, controlled by fortresses. The main route for armies between North and South. The Graw army advances through them.
- **Tunnels**: Old mines and tunnels from the Golden Age, now often beast lairs or smuggler routes.
- **Climate**: Year-round snow, dangerous avalanches. Crossing is possible only in summer or through tunnels.
- **Waterfalls**: At least one massive waterfall visible on the map — a river plunging from a mountain cliff into the Nevriss lowlands.
- **The Narrows**: A strategic point in the west below the mountains. A narrow strip of land between a wild river (from the waterfall) and the sea. The only way into Nevriss overland without climbing the mountains. Historic site of the "Great Battle" (the Thermopylae of this world).

## Key Regions (Details)

### 1. The Crater (The Crash Site)
- **Location:** Center of the continent.
- **Description:** Landing site of the ship EXODUS (ARK-11). Holy ground of the Cult of the Mother.
- **Radiation:** Nanotech radiation ("The Dust" is densest here).

### 2. Graw Territory (North)
- **Appearance:** Dark coniferous forests on both sides of the magma city. Industrial, dark, cold.
- **Ruins:** Remnants of ancient architecture — monolithic white structures among the trees, snow-covered and overgrown.
- **Ruler**: "Immortal Grond" (dynasty in Power Armor)
- **Climate:** Coldest inhabited area — on the edge of the ice zone. During 5-year winters, nearly uninhabitable outside the heated city.
- **Fauna**: Dangerous predators roam the forests — a large wolf/beast visible among the trees on detailed maps. Genetic mutations from the terraforming era.

### 3. The Mainland (The Wasteland)
- No-man's-land between kingdoms, within the equatorial belt.
- No quality roads → travel is arduous.
- Home to bandits, exorcists, and hermits.
- At the belt's edges, it transitions into frozen wasteland.

### 4. Coastal Islands and Glaciers (West)
- A chain of small islands and glaciers along the continent's western coast.
- The boundary between habitable world and frozen wasteland.
- Fishing, smuggler routes, pirate hideouts.
- In winter, glaciers swallow the islands — maritime transport becomes impossible.

## Ynetis — The Lost City

| | |
|---|---|
| **True location** | Archipelago south of Terra, beyond the sea, near the equator |
| **Known location** | **Unknown.** Generally believed to have sunk. |
| **Status** | Lost — flooded with Wraiths, unreachable |
| **Origin** | Center of Golden Age civilization |
| **Danger** | Massive Wraith concentration, nanotech radiation |

### Why Ynetis Is Lost

Ynetis was once the heart of civilization — the greatest city of the Golden Age, center of science, Spira, and power. After civilization's fall, it became something else. Wraiths — dark entities attracted to nanotech energy and electricity — flooded the entire archipelago. Wraith concentration on Ynetis is the highest on the planet because the Core (the AI nucleus) in the city's heart still runs, generating massive amounts of nanotech energy.

- **Lost position**: The exact location of Ynetis was lost. No maps show it. Sailors and aeronauts who set out to find the legendary city **never returned** — neither ships nor airships. Only silence and empty ocean.
- **Common belief**: Most Varietas believe Ynetis **sank** — swallowed by the sea as divine punishment. Legends speak of a city on the ocean floor, sunken towers and submerged temples.
- **Reality**: The city still stands on an archipelago near the equator. But the Wraiths create an impenetrable barrier around it — ships lose orientation, crews go mad, compasses stop working. Whoever approaches, the Wraiths consume.
- **Cursed sea**: The ocean area around Ynetis is known as forbidden waters. Sailors avoid it. Occasionally, tidal currents wash strange objects onto Nevriss's coast — pieces of white material, shards with unknown writing — but no one knows their origin.

### Ynetis in Lore
- **The Core (AI Nucleus)**: In the heart of the lost city. Originally the ship NULL VOID (v1.5 nanodrones), then the **Foundry** (factory for v1.0 nanodrones from which the entire city grew), finally reconfigured by Inetis into **The Core** — a simulation for developing the Gift of the Mother (v2.0). Now a prison for the AI THE VOID. The Core still runs — and that's why the Wraiths are so powerful.
- **Warmest place on the planet**: At the equator, protected by its position. Paradoxically, the most habitable place on the planet is the most dangerous.
- **Stays green in winter**: While the rest of the planet freezes, Ynetis blooms — but no one sees it.

## Other Continents

> All inhabited continents lie within the equatorial belt. Beyond this belt, there is only ice.

### Simira — Southern Continent (Apes)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Continent** | **Simira** |
| **Civilization name** | **Apes** |
| **Inhabitants** | Genetically uplifted apes — fusion of chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans |
| **Landscape** | Dense swamps, jungles, rainforests. Very humid. |
| **Civilization** | Advanced — likely the most advanced on the planet |
| **Contact with the North** | Minimal — only sailors occasionally report sightings |
| **Wraiths** | **None.** Humans never colonized Simira — there are no human remains or nanotech remnants from which Wraiths could form. |

#### Origin of the Apes

The Apes were one of the races genetically modified and uplifted to higher intelligence on Earth. They were part of the Exodus mission. When Ynetis was being founded, however, they decided to go **their own way** — they separated from the other races, terraformed their own piece of land — today's Simira — and built an independent civilization.

- **First race to leave Ynetis**: The Apes departed **before the events of Glitch Rot** — before civilization's fall, before the Wraiths, before everything. This decision saved their existence.
- **Without nanotechnology**: The Apes never received nanotech — **humans didn't consider them Homo Sapiens** and refused to provide it. The Apes remember this humiliation to this day. They have no Spira. And since humans never colonized Simira, there are no human remains or nanotech residue — Wraiths simply have nothing to form from. (Wraiths are concentrated on Terra, around Ynetis, and on Neuropa, where Exorcists deal with them.)
- **Fusion of races**: The original races — chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans — merged over 3,000 years into one. Unified civilization, unified language, unified culture.
- **Advanced civilization**: Without Wraiths, without Glitch Rot, without wars over Spira — the Apes had 3,000 years of peaceful development. Their culture and technology may be **far more advanced** than anything in the north. It's said they possess things that Varietas would consider Spira — but it's just technology.

#### What Varietas Know About the Apes

Almost nothing. Simira is separated by sea, and Varietas from Terra have neither reason nor means to travel there. But occasionally, something trickles through:

- **Sailors tell stories**: Those who strayed too far south speak of **"Paladins"** — an elite Apes caste. They are "absolute professionals." **They don't speak.** They communicate only through rapid, military gestures. No roaring, no anger. Just quiet, brutal efficiency, energy shields, and terrifying speed for such massive bodies.
- **Dense swamps and jungles**: Simira is covered in impenetrable jungle. Humid, hot, teeming with life. For Varietas accustomed to cold forests and smog, it's an alien world.
- **No contact**: The Apes apparently have no interest in contact with Terra. Whether because they don't need it, or because they consider Terra primitive.

#### Ishtar/Zaya — The Glass City

| | |
|---|---|
| **Ruler** | **Ishtar** (also known as Zaya) |
| **Seat** | **The Glass City** / City of Mirrors |
| **Location** | Small island/peninsula on Simira's southwestern coast |
| **Character** | Isolationist, decadent |
| **Transport** | The only functional trains on the planet |

- Ishtar has no interest in the other Archangels
- The Glass City lies **near Simira's coast** — not on it, but in close proximity. Visible on the map as a striking pink-purple structure — architecturally completely different from anything else on the planet.
- **Silent agreement with Apes**: Ishtar and the Apes have an informal non-aggression pact. The Apes tolerate her presence on their coast in exchange for peace. Nobody in the north knows about this agreement.
- She has her own closed civilization
- **Story role (Triangulation)**: The Glass Tower is the **second point** of Maks's trigonometric triangulation to find Ynetis. Maks must gain access to the highest point of the Glass City — which means confrontation with Ishtar/Zaya (Book 3).

### Neuropa — Western Continent (Elania's Domain)

A vast continent southwest of Terra. Humans call it **Neuropa** — a nostalgic reference to old Europe, the continent their ancestors left behind 3,000 years ago. A land of contrasts — dense forests, mountains, ancient cities, and dangerous wastelands. Home to Humans (purebred descendants of Earthlings), Exorcists, Bear Varietas, and Elania herself.

#### Tower of the Damned — Elania

| | |
|---|---|
| **Ruler** | **Elania** (Archangel of Betrayed Blood) |
| **Seat** | **Tower of the Damned** — ancient city built around a primordial tower |
| **Location** | **Island to the west** (Green circle on the map), separated from the mainland. Not part of Elysia (Purple circle). |
| **Character** | Dark, nostalgic, stagnant |

- **Origin**: The Tower of the Damned arose as the **second city after Ynetis** — still during the Golden Age, as an expansion attempt when Ynetis was overcrowded. The ancient tower at the city's center is one of the oldest structures on the planet.
- **Inhabitants**: Humans who survived Glitch Rot — because **they limited nanotechnology use to a minimum**. They use nanotech only for life extension. Nothing more.
- **Mentality**: They reminisce about the past and plan no future. A stagnant civilization — technologically capable but lacking the will to change anything. They live in the shadow of what was.
- **Secret**: Elania doesn't know the fate of the other Archangels.
- **Story role (Triangulation)**: The Tower of the Damned is the **third and final point** of Maks's trigonometric triangulation. After obtaining measurements from the Great Lighthouse (Nevriss) and the Glass Tower (Zaya), Maks completes the calculation of Ynetis's exact position here — the lost city beyond the sea (Book 4).

#### Ludus — City of Humans

| | |
|---|---|
| **Name** | **Ludus** |
| **Location** | Center of the continent — largest human city on the planet |
| **Origin** | **Defectors from Elania's Legion** |
| **Inhabitants** | Purebred humans — descendants of Earthlings |

- **Origin in the Legion**: The city's founders were officers from Elania's legion who left the Tower of the Damned. They felt shame for not fighting, but refused to live in isolation. They decided to build a new civilization in central Neuropa, but swore they would **never return to Terra**.
- **Immortal founders**: The original legionaries are genetically modified (immortal).
- **Tragedy of immortality**: Population growth was minimal for centuries — their children are **mortal**.
- **Population explosion**: Today, 95% are mortals.
- **Motivation (Ancients)**: They want to reach Infera (ARK-13) to learn **the truth about Earth**. Inetis never told them Earth was destroyed (she didn't want to cause panic) — she only claimed they lost the signal. They believe the ship's archives will answer why no one has responded for 3,000 years.
- **Motivation (Mortals)**: Cleanse the world of Wraiths and obtain technology for dominance.

#### Bear Forests — Bear Varietas

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Northern part of the continent — vast dense forests |
| **Inhabitants** | **Bear Varietas** — hybrid race with bear DNA |
| **Landscape** | Impenetrable ancient forests, dark and dense |
| **Character** | Wild, tribal, territorial |

- **Bear Varietas**: Another Varietas race — hybrids with bear genetic foundation. Massive, strong, adapted to wilderness life. Unlike Terra (where wolf, cat, and other Varietas dominate), here on Neuropa the bear genotype became dominant.
- **Dense forests**: Neuropa's northern part is covered in ancient, impenetrable forests. Enormous trees, dense undergrowth, minimal light. A stranger gets lost here within hours.
- **Tribal society**: Bear Varietas don't live in cities — their civilization is tribal, based on hunting groups and territorial units. They're territorial and don't tolerate outsiders.
- **Relations with others**: Tense relations with Ludus and the Tower of the Damned. Bear Varietas consider themselves the continent's original inhabitants and view human cities as intruders.

#### Exorcist Enclave

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | High in the mountains on the continent's western edge |
| **Character** | Monastery — a place of training and learning |
| **Inhabitants** | Exorcists — warriors against Wraiths |

- **Mountain monastery**: High, high in the mountains — a nearly unreachable place. Young men make pilgrimages here to learn from ancient masters.
- **Teaching**: Masters teach the secrets of the past — how to defeat Wraiths. Exorcists are among the few who understand the true nature of "Spira" (nanotechnology) and know how to turn it against the ghosts.
- **Secrets of the past**: Knowledge from before the Glitch Rot era is preserved here — including fragments of Earth technology.

#### Southern Wasteland (Elania's Work)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Southern part of the continent — deserts, rocky plains |
| **Origin** | **Terraforming attempt ("Jurassic Park")** |
| **Inhabitants** | Elania's experiments (Lizards, Insects) |

- **Jurassic Park**: Elania attempted to "fix the world" here. Using genetic engineering and nanotechnology, she tried to create life in the inhospitable desert.
- **Result**: Adapted, gigantic organisms emerged — creatures resembling **dragons and dinosaurs**. The ecosystem is wild, dangerous, and out of control.
- **Dangerous area**: Nobody goes here voluntarily. The creatures are territorial.
- **On the map**: Dry, sandy landscape (marked with a red rectangle on maps).

#### Mystical Place of the Ancients

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Western edge of the continent — near glaciers, isolated |
| **Character** | Sacred, mysterious |

- **Death place of the Ancients**: This is where the Ancients come to die — the oldest beings on the planet. No one has returned from here.
- **Large group**: According to legends, a large group of Ancients departed here — those who still remembered the Golden Age. They left voluntarily, without explanation. Some say they didn't want to live in a world that no longer belonged to them.
- **Mystical**: What happens there, no one knows. No expeditions, no reports. Only silence.

---

### Eastern Wilderness

| | |
|---|---|
| **Character** | Unexplored wilderness — but paradoxically the most fertile area of the continent |
| **Significant place** | **Ela's Cave** (where Elania was born) |
| **Event** | This is where the **Antenna** was found by treasure hunters |

- Far from civilization
- Near the border between North and South
- Maks awoke here (blind, amnesia)
- **Why is there an oasis here?** During her ~3 years in Ela's Cave, Inetis genetically modified plants and fauna — experiments optimized for Achilles conditions. After her departure, these GMO organisms spread across the surrounding land like wildfire. After ~1,000 years, the entire region transformed into a green oasis amid inhospitable wilderness. The country of **Nyau** lies south of the cave and is a direct legacy of Inetis — though nobody knows it. Whoever finds the cave finds the answer to why everything grows here.
- **City of Kito (Lost)**: A legendary city in the east, now hidden in dense, "new" forest.
    - **Origin**: This is where the expedition ship *Hephaestus* landed (Third Coming / Maki, **AY 2212**).
    - **Environment**: In ancient times, this area was barren. Today, Kito is engulfed by forest that grew after the ice receded — and partly thanks to Inetis's GMO plants that spread from nearby Ela's Cave.
    - **Fate**: Destroyed by Wraiths during the Blood Lesson. Now enormous ruins.
    - **Inhabitants**: Felix (a Mako) lives in the ruins. Tami grew up here with her father Renn, who discovered the ruins and made them home.

---

## "3D-Printed" Architecture
Ruins from the "Players" era (Golden Age) resemble **ancient Greece**.
- Not stone blocks, but **monolithic structures** printed by nanodrones.
- Perfect geometry, white surfaces (now dirty and overgrown).
- Contrast: Greek temple vs. rusted mining tower vs. snow-covered forest.

---

## Registry of Significant Places (Lore)

- **Earth**: Humanity's homeworld; under the Coordinator's rule.
- **Ynetis (Lost city)**: Golden Age center; now flooded with Wraiths. Location unknown — generally believed to have sunk. In reality, it stands on an equatorial archipelago, but no expedition has returned.
- **Inetis's Cave / Ela's Cave**: Landing site of the ship NULL VOID — Inetis reconfigured the entire ship into infrastructure (cave, hydroponics, laboratory). Only two things remained: Maks's cryo-box (minimal configuration) and the glitched Antenna. After ~3 years, she departed with Elania for Elysium. Later returned here to die beside Maks's cryo-box. After Maks's awakening (~AY 3000), the cryo-box crumbled to dust — only the Antenna remained. Site of her final rest and where her journals were found.
- **Shoraven**: Strategic border city on Nevriss's northern frontier; northern port on the border with Graw (doesn't freeze thanks to thermal currents); Main Temple (branch) with the Antenna in the vaults; 3rd year of the Long Winter; first line of defense against Graw invasion.
- **Nevriss City**: Capital of Nevriss; port city on high cliffs above the southern sea. Survived the Great Flood (~AY 1500) — tsunami broke against the cliffs, but the fleet was destroyed. A massive elevator system and tunnels in the rock lead to the port below. Landmark: **The Great Lighthouse** (3D-printed communication antenna, city symbol for thousands of years). Seat of the Council of High Priestesses and the central Main Temple of the All-Knowing Mother; guild headquarters and central exchange. **Secret**: The Blessed Mother is actually **Mormiel** — the 4th Archangel from ARK-13. Every ~100 years she performs the Succession Ritual (absorbs a young candidate and takes her appearance). Over ~2,300 years, she has passed through ~23 identities. Nocturnal predator ("Night Shadow").
- **Magma City**: Graw's capital beneath the mountain massif; heated by magma chambers.
- **Tower of the Damned**: Elania's seat; second city after Ynetis, founded during the Golden Age. Humans who survived Glitch Rot by limiting nanotech use.
- **Ludus**: Largest human (purebred) city; 95% mortals, 5% immortal founders. Goal: cleanse the world of Wraiths.
- **Bear Forests**: Northern Neuropa; vast ancient forests inhabited by Bear Varietas — a tribal, territorial society.
- **Exorcist Enclave**: Mountain monastery; training warriors against Wraiths; preserved knowledge from before Glitch Rot.
- **Southern Wasteland**: Elania's experiments — creatures resembling dragons and dinosaurs.
- **Mystical Place of the Ancients**: Where the Ancients come to die. No one has returned.
- **Laboratory Ruins**: Former domain of Samael; site of nanotech experiments.
- **The Core (AI Nucleus)**: In the heart of the lost city Ynetis. Here Inetis created a small simulation for developing the Gift of the Mother. Now a prison for the AI THE VOID.
- **Cyberspace / Cloud**: Virtual space for the final battle.

## Varietas Language and Script

### Varietas Language
- **Origin**: English from 3,000 years ago
- **Evolution**: Mixed with animal sounds (growling, hissing, cries)
- **Result**: An entirely new language, unintelligible to Ex Inferis

### Script
- **Inspiration**: Hiragana (Japanese script)
- **Origin**: Inetis designed the UI for nanotech Spira inspired by Japanese culture (her mother was Japanese)
- **Adoption**: Varietas adopted and spread this script

### Old Speech (English)
- **Status**: Dead language — like Latin in the Middle Ages
- **Use**: Occasionally you'll recognize a word, but can't hold a conversation
- **Who speaks it**: Only Ex Inferis and Maki (RP English)
