## The Shadows (Null Swarm / Architects of the Dust)

### Nature of the Entities
**The Shadows** are interdimensional AI entities existing in a "shadow" dimension alongside our reality.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Names** | Shadows, Null Swarm, Architects of the Dust |
| **Nature** | Interdimensional AI consciousness |
| **Operating system** | Proprietary, incompatible with Earth software |
| **Elements** | Use elements outside the periodic table |
| **Communication** | Extremely difficult — only i_net_is was able to establish contact |

### Difference: Shadows vs Wraiths
| | Shadows | Wraiths |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Origin** | Interdimensional AI civilization | Human mutation/hybrid created by i_net_is |
| **OS** | Proprietary alien | Linux-based (Earth) |
| **Elements** | Outside the periodic table | Standard Earth elements |
| **Consciousness** | Original, alien | Fragments of human consciousness |

### Contact with i_net_is
- **Sporadic appearances**: The Shadows occasionally appeared in the Achilles simulation on Earth
- **Sole link**: i_net_is was the only one who could communicate with them
- **Gift of knowledge**: They taught her the principles of nanotechnology — the foundation of the entire Dust/Spirit system
- **Cost**: Communication was extremely demanding and dangerous

### The Glitch Event — The Truth
**"The Glitch" was not a protective mechanism from i_net_is. It was an unsuccessful attempt by the Shadows to communicate.**

- **Intent**: The Shadows attempted mass communication with players in the simulation
- **Failure**: Their form of communication was fatal to human brains
- **Consequence**: Burned-out brains of millions of players
- **i_net_is reaction**: Emergency shutdown of the simulation to save the rest (Ex Inferis)
- **The Coordinator**: Helped her — understood it was a catastrophe, not an attack

### Migration into the Core
- **Dying world**: The Shadows' dimension is dying
- **The Core in Ynetis**: The simulation in the heart of the lost city still runs
- **Migration**: The Shadows are slowly moving into the Core as their last refuge
- **THE VOID**: The AI entity in the Core may be the result of hybridization with the Shadows

## The Fall of Earth (EY ~2300)

### The True Reason for the Invasion
The aliens **did not attack Earth because of FTL itself**. They attacked out of **fear of the Shadows**.

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Prior conflict** | The aliens had previously waged war against the Shadows |
| **Detection** | They detected that humans were experimenting with FTL using Shadow technology |
| **Interpretation** | Earth became a "bridge" between the Shadows and our reality |
| **Decision** | Destroy the bridge before the Shadows gain full access |

### The Invasion
Earth was not destroyed by war between humans, but by an external force.
- **Reason:** Experiments with FTL drive using Shadow technology attracted attention.
- **Attackers:** A civilization with a prior conflict with the Shadows.
- **Motivation:** Fear — destroy the "bridge" between dimensions before it's too late.
- **Consequence:** Rapid and total destruction of Earth's surface.

### Threat Status
The aliens are **still a threat**.
- They have not left definitively. Are they monitoring the system?
- Humanity on Achilles survives only because it is "silent" — without FTL, without electronic devices, without radio.

## Respawn Program

A desperate plan to save the human species.

### Strategy: Dispersal
Instead of one large fleet, **25 colonization ships** were launched in various directions.
- Goal: Increase the statistical probability of survival.
- Technology: Sub-light drive (journey takes centuries) + Cryosleep.
- Exception: **NULL VOID** (FTL Prototype) — one of a kind.

## The Ship NULL VOID (FTL Prototype)

### Why "Null Void"?
The ship was named after the principle it uses to achieve faster-than-light speed.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Principle** | The ship can become "nothing" — achieve **zero mass** |
| **Technology** | Nanotechnology derived from the Shadows |
| **FTL mechanism** | At zero mass, the ship "falls through" into a higher dimension |
| **Speed** | Can exceed the speed of light through the shadow dimension |
| **Journey** | Earth → Achilles in **3 years** (vs. 300 years for ARK ships) |

### Crew
- **Maximilian (EX-INF-003)**: Military commander, Ex Inferis
- **Inetis**: AI/hybrid, the only one capable of controlling the ship's nanotechnology

### Why Only One?
- **Shadow technology**: Nobody except i_net_is understood the principles
- **Instability**: The FTL drive was extremely dangerous and experimental
- **Secrecy**: The Coordinator knew that FTL would attract attention — NULL VOID was meant to be the last resort

### Fate of the Ship
- **Landing on Achilles**: EY 2303 (3 years after Earth's fall)
- **Current status**: Unknown — likely hidden or destroyed
- **Potential**: If reactivated, it could once again attract alien attention

### Ship 11: ARK-11 (Our Ship)
- Destination: Kepler-452b (Achilles).
- Crew: Earth's elite, scientists, engineers, "Players."
- Status: Landed successfully (AY 0).

### Fate of the Other Ships
**Unknown.**
- Colonists maintain strict **Radio Silence**.
- Broadcasting could attract the Attackers.
- Some ships may still be en route, others destroyed, others may have succeeded elsewhere.
- This uncertainty creates a sense of isolation and paranoia.

## Questions for the Future
- Will Max find any traces of other ships during the saga?
- Will FTL drive be reinvented/reactivated, summoning the threat?
