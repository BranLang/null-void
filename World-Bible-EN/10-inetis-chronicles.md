## First Contact with the World (The Descent)

Inetis spent a long period isolated inside **The Core** — a simulation she created by reconfiguring the **Foundry** (a factory producing v1.0 nanodrones, originally the ship NULL VOID). It wasn't an escape — it was a desperate attempt to find a cure for **Glitch Rot**, which had begun devouring the city — specifically, the same v1.0 nanobots the Foundry manufactured and from which all of Elysium was built. She risked everything — sealed herself inside the simulation, hoping to save her daughter and her people.

When she finally found the solution (the Gen 2 prototype / Spira / Gift of the Mother) and emerged, it was too late.

Around the year **AY 700**, she opened the gates of The Core to silence. The city of **Elysium** (later Ynetis) was empty. Elania was gone. The colonists had vanished. She had the cure, but there was no one left to save.

In the ruins she found only a handful of surviving Exorcists hiding in the shadows. With them, heartbroken, she abandoned the ghost city and set out to find civilization on the Mainland (Nevriss).

## The Burden of Knowledge (The Awakening)

What she found in Nevriss shocked her in ways she hadn't expected.

She found Varietas living in fear. It was from them that she learned the cruel truth about the **Archangels**.
- She learned about raids by "demons" (Ex Inferis) from the flying city.
- She learned about the abductions of women and children.
- She learned about the senseless slaughter carried out for sport.

She understood that her former friends and her own daughter had not become victims — they had become tyrants.

---

## The Moral Dilemma (Gen 1 (v1.0) vs Gen 2 (v2.0))

She spent years (AY 710–740) in an agony of indecision.

She had the **Gen 2 (v2.0)** technology (Spira), originally developed as a cure for the people of Elysium. Now she saw a new purpose for it.
- *If I give the Varietas this power, will they use it for defense?*
- *Or will they become the same monsters as those who oppress them?*

She saw the suffering of the Varietas. She watched mothers weep over stolen children. And she understood that neutrality was also a choice — a choice to let them die.

---

## Magnum Opus (Spira)

She made her decision. She adapted her "Cure" into a "Weapon/Tool."

**Gen 2 (v2.0) Parameters:**
1.  **Power Downgrade:** She had to sacrifice 90% of v1.7's raw power to achieve stability. Spira cannot reshape reality the way the Archangels can, but it is far more flexible.
2.  **Sophistication:** Unlike v1.x, this version can **store itself within crystalline structures** (Spira Crystals), effectively creating Spira batteries.
3.  **Genetic Lock:** Compatible with **Varietas** (modified humans — human-base genome). **Incompatible with Chimeras** (Ghorki — modified animals). Inetis didn't have time to solve compatibility with animal genomes — access to The Core was extremely difficult and limited.
4.  **Self-Replication:** Heritable from mother to child (v1.x are sterile).

### The Language of Code (Return to Roots)
When she taught them to use the Gift, she knew who the enemy was.
She knew that the Ex Inferis (Archangels) spoke English (Old Speech).
So for Spira she chose **Japanese** — a language understood only by her and the dead of Earth.
- **Syntax as Poetry:** She disguised the code within Haiku.
- **Purpose:** To the Ex Inferis, it was just Spira. They couldn't hack it. **Without access to the Earth archives (which Inetis had erased)**, they had no chance of deciphering Haiku syntax.

### Blessing by Touch (The Blessing)
Inetis did not distribute Spira en masse. Every recipient had to be **blessed personally — by touch**. This ritual was not magical but technical: upon skin contact, Inetis transferred active Gen 2 nanodrones that integrated into the host's genome and became heritable.

- **Heredity:** The Blessing passes from parent to child. Descendants of the blessed are born with active Spira.
- **Her Team from Elysium:** When Inetis left the ruins of Elysium and set out to find civilization, she did not go alone. She was accompanied by a handful of survivors — **humans** — who had survived Glitch Rot in the shadow of The Core. They were the first to be blessed. The team numbered **~20 members**, among them **Renn** (a civilian from ARK-11) and **Sera** (a Japanese veteran). Together they built schools, hospitals, and carried supplies to the colony of Neverice (Nevriss).
- **Humans with Spira:** Among the blessed were also humans (Homo Sapiens Sapiens). For them, Spira v2.0 functioned the same as for Varietas — it was designed for the human genome, and Varietas are simply genetically modified humans. These humans gave up version 1.0 and switched to 2.0.
- **The Team's Fate:** After the Great War, most of her human team remained in Nevriss. Their descendants still live on the **southern coast of Terra** — communities of "Blessed Ones" who carry Spira like the Varietas but have preserved their pure human bodies.

## The Great War (The Great War)

![The Great War - clash of Spira and technology](assets/books/Inetis/Gemini_Generated_Image_mfok24mfok24mfok.png)

Around the year **AY 850**, the inevitable came. The Varietas, empowered by Spira, began building cities. They stopped being afraid.

**Ex Inferis attacked.**
It was not Elania who led them. At the time, she was merely a "fifth wheel" — ignored and without real power.
The expedition was led by the Triumvirate: **Grond** (Strength), **Samaell** (Death), and **Zaiya/Ishtar** (Illusion). They wanted the "Gift of the Mother" for themselves.

The war was brutal. Human legions (v1.0) collided with the First Tamers (v2.0).
- **The Fox Genocide:** The Fox Clan (Vulpes) were the **leaders and intelligence** of the Varietas — the shrewdest strategists and most talented Spira programmers. That made them the primary target.
    - **Exodus:** After a battle with an unclear outcome, the last fox families fled East into unexplored wastelands. **Renn** — a member of Inetis's Core Team — volunteered to escort them through the dangerous Wilds. **Inetis herself went with them** — not alone as some legends say, but with the foxes and Renn.
    - **The Prophecy (Kito):** They didn't flee randomly. Inetis had given them secret coordinates. She told them that in the distant future, the **Maki (Synthetics)** would land at this location — the "**Third Coming**" from the heavens. The First were the Colonists, the Second were the Ex Inferis. The Third would be the Builders.
    - **Origin of the Maki:** These synthetics were launched from Earth **before the Player Revolution** (late 21st century era). Their technology is old, "primitive" (hardware, not nanotech), and their journey through space takes **2,000 years**.
    - **Legacy:** They founded the city of **Kitana** (Kito) as a **waiting place**. The foxes survive to welcome these pilgrims.
    - **A Fourth Coming?**: Inetis said nothing about a Fourth. But the Varietas reasoned that if there were three "Builders," the fourth must be the one who finishes it. **The Sleeper**.

### Mother in the Mud (End of the War)

![Mother in the Mud - Inetis in the ruins of war](assets/books/Inetis/Gemini_Generated_Image_xzqzsrxzqzsrxzqz.png)

In the decisive battle at the **Atra Narrows** beneath Hangravall (the only mainland passage into Nevriss, squeezed between river and sea — the local "Thermopylae"), Inetis appeared on the battlefield.

The Ex Inferis ignored her, convinced they could break through the narrows by brute force. But the Varietas used the terrain. In the confined space, the Archangels' advantage was negated. The Foxes (Vulpes) and Varietas formed a wall of Spira and bodies that the Ex Inferis could not breach.

**Consequences (The Triumvirate Shatters):**
1.  **Grond (North):** Retreated beyond the Hangravall mountains. Betrayed and enraged, he began building a new army (Graw), swearing vengeance.
2.  **Zaiya/Ishtar (South):** Lost everything (her legion). In shame, she withdrew to the Southern continent (**Simira**), where she later built her isolated Glass City.
3.  **Samaell (The Wanderer):** Sank into depression and madness. He cast off leadership and became a wanderer and killer, addicted to stealing "blood" (techno-vampirism).
4.  **Elania:** Her legion never entered the battle. When she saw the Mother, she wept, but her shame was too great to face her. She withdrew to her **Tower of the Damned** on an isolated island west of the mainland.
    - **Jurassic Park:** For a time, she tried to make amends — in southern Neuropa she began terraforming and created adapted organisms in the desert (lizards, insects).
    - **The Legion Scatters:** Her legions split. Many departed for central Neuropa, where they founded new cities (e.g., Ludus). They never returned to Terra out of shame.

Inetis remained sitting in the mud while her world fell apart. Not by military defeat, but by the moral collapse of her "children."

### The Broken Heart (The Breakdown)

![Inetis Breakdown](assets/books/Inetis/Inetis_breakdown.png)

This is the moment that defined her end. While the Varietas celebrated their victory and erected statues in her honor, she wept.
- **The True Face (Human Mother):** The oldest statues in Shoraven depict her this way — a human woman kneeling in the mud, her eyes violet from tears (a symbol of the universe she lost). No ears, no tail. Just a human.
- **The False Idol (Cat Mother):** The Church later "revised" this truth. They added cat ears to make her look like Varietas (Fox/Cat). They turned her tears into "pentagrams of power" so she would appear as a goddess of war, not a mother in despair.

Inetis did not die in battle. She died inside that day at the Atra Narrows, when she saw how her gift (Spira) was being used for killing and how her own people (Ex Inferis) murdered for power. She understood that she had failed as a Scientist and as a Mother.

## The Final Journey (Searching for Maks)

After the war, broken and dying of Glitch Rot (which she contracted while working on Gen 2 in The Core), she resolved on one last desperate act — even knowing she would likely never make it.
She feared the wars would never end. That her children would never stop fighting.
She needed someone who could do what she could not. Someone who would impose order.
On the road to the cave, she spent much time remembering the past and came to realize that Maks hadn't been all that bad. What had happened between them no longer seemed so terrible. She even convinced herself it had been her fault.

### Why She Refused Treatment
Inetis had Gen 2 Spira. She could have healed herself — slowly, gradually, but she could have. **She refused.**
- **Tired of living** — Centuries of solitude. Losing Elania. The guilt of the Glitch Event and millions dead on Earth. The guilt of the wars on Achilles. She did not want to live forever.
- **She felt she didn't deserve to be saved** — She created the technology that turned the world into a battlefield. Her daughter became a monster. Her beloved slept in ice because of her fear.
- **She deliberately chose to die beside Maks** — She didn't go to the cave to wake him. She went there to die next to him. She wanted the last thing she saw to be him. She wanted to ask his forgiveness. And to ask him to save Elania from the Ex Inferis.

**For her, death was redemption.** She felt old and exhausted. A thousand years is far too long for a human — or whatever she had become — to still want to live.

**Why did she die after 1,000 years when others survive 3,000+?** The Archangels and Elania survive — but at the cost of cannibalism and their humanity. They devour others to replace their decaying nanobots. Inetis **never crossed that line**. She never consumed anyone. She remained human. And it was precisely this conscience — the guilt over the Glitch Event, over millions dead, over Elania, over Maks in the ice — that ultimately killed her. The others survived because they became monsters. **Inetis died because she refused to become one.**
**Mission:** Find Maks.

### Why on Foot, in Secret
- **The Ex Inferis want Spira** — the remaining Ex Inferis (Archangels and their allies) knew Inetis carried Gen 2 Spira. If she had used any vehicle, they would have tracked her.
- **She knew they would be watching** — so she set out alone, on foot, carrying only the Antenna (the Antenna made her invisible to nanodrones and other technologies; it also functioned as a jammer when its subspace polarity was reversed). No signals, no technology they could intercept.
- **She realized she needed Maks** — he was the only one who could defeat them. A military strategist without mercy, without Spira, without dependence on the technology the Archangels controlled.

She knew where they had originally landed — the Ela Cave in the Eastern Wilds, where she had once reconfigured the entire ship NULL VOID into infrastructure and where Maks's cryobox still stood in minimal configuration. She traveled for two years on foot. She survived on whatever she could find in the wild and on the last remnants of Spira. She remembered the early days in the cave, eating algae porridge and drinking water from puddles.
**She took the Antenna with her** — her faithful staff, the tool with which she had built Elysium and which had protected her throughout all her journeys. Without it, she would not have survived the trip.
The journey took two years. She walked. Her nanotechnology batteries were failing. Every step was agony.
- She crossed through snowstorms of the North.
- She survived attacks by wild beasts only thanks to the last traces of Spira and the **Antenna**, which repelled Wraiths.

### Thoughts Along the Way
On the road to the cave, she spent much time thinking and remembering. She imagined how things might have gone if they had been together. Whether Elania would have grown up differently with a father. Whether the wars would have erupted at all if Maks had stood by her side. The longer she walked, the more she realized that what she had once perceived as his brutality might have simply been his way of loving. And maybe — maybe — what had happened between them on the ship was not entirely his fault. She grew ever more resolved to wake him. To tell him everything. To ask for forgiveness.

### Death in the Cave
When she reached the cave (or rather the bunker — a labyrinth she alone knew, carved into granite rock), she found the remnants of her old home — walls covered in drawings (Elania's work), the remains of hydroponic farms, terminals that had once governed their lives.
- **Maks's cryobox:** The sole module in the cave, in minimal configuration. After 1,000 years of operation, the nanodrones were on the brink of collapse. The status lights blinked green — Maks inside was alive: the nanodrones maintained his basic functions, but his body was paying the price.
- **Her plan:** Originally she wanted to wake him and explain everything. But she didn't even have the strength for the awakening process itself. And perhaps, after all those centuries, she was still afraid of that moment.



She sat down beside his module. She pressed her forehead against the cold glass.
*"I'm sorry, Maks. I let you sleep for too long. Now you'll have to clean up this mess yourself."*

She died there, in the silence of the cave.
Her body transformed into an onyx statue and crumbled to dust (the nanobots deactivated and left the host). All that remained were her diaries (leather-bound volumes she had written over the years), her bones — and the **Antenna**, laid beside her like a faithful guardian.
Maks slept on, unaware that the woman he loved had died half a meter from his face.

## Wraith Inetis (The Ghost in the Cave)

Inetis — a.k.a. i_net_is, born Neto Fujiwara — died, but not entirely. Her "hungry" nanodrones remained in the cave alongside her bones and the diary she had written during her journey. Without a host, they entered a dormant state but did not lose their data. Fragments of her consciousness, memories, and scientific knowledge remained encoded in the nanodrone dust that covered her remains.

The Ela Cave became a forgotten place on a very sparsely populated planet (something like Siberia on Earth). The residual nanodrone intelligence waited — for a new host.

### Contact with Tami (~AY 3011)

Around the year **AY 3011**, a treasure-hunting expedition reached the cave: **Arkot, Yera, Flint** — and with them, **Tami**. They found the cave using an old map originally purchased by her father **Renn** on the black market — and it cost him his life (the pirates Vix and Kael killed him over it and stole Makita). The map never left Makita — it sat in the ship's hold for years. As a 7-year-old, Tami had no idea what it was — she found it and deciphered it years later while cleaning out Makita, by which time she was an experienced treasure hunter.

Tami touched the remains of Inetis. In that moment, the "hungry" nanodrones recognized a compatible host — a Vulpini with an exceptionally strong Spira — and transferred to her. Tami felt nothing. No pain, no sign. Just cold dust on her fingertips.

**Consequences:**
- From this moment on, Tami carries the **Echo of Inetis** — fragments of memories, scientific terminology, and abilities (healing, regeneration). They manifest slowly, subconsciously — nightmares in a foreign language, intuition she cannot explain.
- **Subconscious Motivation:** The Echo of Inetis pulls her toward Maks. Tami believes she seeks him for herself — for unresolved feelings. In truth, it is Inetis who, even after death, strives to fulfill her final plan: to wake Maks.
- Tami does not know about the Echo. At the start of Book 1, she already carries the wraith, but its effects are subtle — which is why she is so exceptionally skilled with Spira (beyond what Maks taught her).

### Fate of the Expedition

Arkot, Yera, and Flint were **publicly burned at the stake in the Shoraven square** on the direct order of the Blessed Mother (Mormiel) after their return. They knew too much about the location of the Cave of Origin — the resting place of the "Holy Mother" and potentially other artifacts. Mormiel wanted the cave for herself.

Tami survived because **Mormiel didn't know about her** — she was not officially recorded as a member of the expedition. All Tami knows is that the Church killed her friends for "desecrating holy relics." She does not know the real reason.
