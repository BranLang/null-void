# NULL VOID — World Identity

> This is not a marketing document. It's a compass — so that when expanding the sandbox, you know what tone to hold, what the DNA of this world is, and why this combination works.

---

## 1. What It Is

**Anime Sci-Fi Dieselpunk Grimdark Novel**

It's not one genre with flavoring from another. It's a **DNA helix** — four strands twisted into a single organism:

| Strand | What It Brings | Example in NULL VOID |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Anime** | Archetypes, tonal shifts, visual character design, worldbuilding through action | Tami = tsundere pirate. Sera = kawaii voice in a killer's body. "Kowai." Goat-horned agitator with a pentagram necklace = black metal vibe. |
| **Sci-Fi (Hard)** | Rules, limits, logic, Clarke's Law as plot engine | Pentagram = IDE. Prayers = voice-activated scripts. Wraiths = nanobots with self-preservation instinct. |
| **Dieselpunk** | Aesthetic, technological level, atmosphere | Hydrogen airships, revolvers, art deco, no electronics. Pipes, gears, steam. |
| **Grimdark** | Consequences, moral complexity, no plot armor | Public burnings. Body horror (Maya → crystal). Caste system. Death is permanent. |

### Format: Authorial, Not Conventional

NULL VOID **is not a light novel**. It has no format constraints of traditional light novels. It's an **authorial series** that takes archetypes and aesthetics from anime, but writes by its own rules:

- **Chapters are as long as they need to be** — if a scene needs space, it gets it
- **Atmospheric "fat" stays** — a goat-horned agitator preaching about false gods isn't filler, it's worldbuilding. A black humanoid goat with a pentagram on his neck = a visual that defines the tone of the world.
- **Trimming fat** = removing redundant exposition and over-explanation, **NOT** atmosphere, worldbuilding and visuals that build the world
- **Genre conventions are inspiration, not boundaries** — if a scene works, it stays, regardless of format

### Why This Combination Doesn't Exist

Anime and grimdark don't typically mix — anime resets consequences (power-up solves everything), grimdark lacks levity. Dieselpunk is a rare genre in itself. And hard sci-fi beneath a fantasy surface is rarer still — few do it well (Wolfe, Vance, Banks).

NULL VOID is the answer to the question: "What if Nausicaä had Fullmetal's lore, Tanya's brutality, and its own voice?"

## 2. DNA — Comparable Titles

### Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (Miyazaki, 1984)

| What We Take | What We Add |
|------------|-------------|
| Epic world, ecological themes, old technology mistakenly taken for nature | Hard sci-fi foundation (nanotech IS that "nature"), darker consequences, multi-POV |
| 5-part structure (manga), philosophical depth | Caste system, institutional violence, moral gray zones |

**Key difference:** Nausicaä is fundamentally optimistic. NULL VOID earns its hope through suffering.

### The Saga of Tanya the Evil (Youjo Senki)

| What We Take | What We Add |
|------------|-------------|
| Dieselpunk + "magic" in a military setting, morally complex protagonist | 3,000 years of lore depth, family as emotional core (not isekai reincarnation) |
| WW1/WW2 aesthetic, tactical combat | Multi-continental world, Wraith evolutionary cycle, Upload dilemma |

**Key difference:** Tanya is one POV, one war. NULL VOID is multi-generational, multi-continental.

### Fullmetal Alchemist (Arakawa)

| What We Take | What We Add |
|------------|-------------|
| Hard "magic" with rules and cost, philosophical questions about humanity, humor + darkness | Sci-fi foundation (not alchemy, but nanotech), deeper deception (characters don't know their magic is tech) |
| Sibling/family relationship as core | Father-daughter tragedy, where the daughter is an antagonist with 2,750 years of solitude |

**Key difference:** FMA is shōnen with a clear moral compass. NULL VOID is morally grayer — even the "hero" was a military killer.

### Other DNA Traces

- **Made in Abyss** — cute characters in horrifying situations, worldbuilding depth
- **Attack on Titan** — mystery boxes, layered conspiracies, grimdark tone, hidden truths
- **Cowboy Bebop** — melancholy + humor, character-driven, episodic structure within a larger arc
- **Ghost in the Shell** — AI/consciousness philosophy, cyberpunk aesthetic, identity and body

## 3. Tone Spectrum (Tone Dial)

Tone in NULL VOID isn't binary (dark OR funny). It's a **spectrum**:

```
1 ──────────── 5 ──────────── 10
GRIMDARK         NEUTRAL         ANIME HUMOR
```

### Mapping by Scene Type

| Scene Type | Range | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Combat / survival | 2-4 | Paladins in the sewers. Mercy-kill of experiments. Bombardment of Shoraven. |
| Worldbuilding / exploration | 4-6 | Mako workshop with tea ceremony. Shoraven marketplace. |
| Bonding / downtime | 6-8 | Tami snark aboard the Makita. Maks the "tourist" at customs. |
| Politics / religion | 3-5 | Goro Interlude. Church exorcisms. Sera/Elania dialogue. |
| Sera scenes | 2-8 | Deliberately unpredictable — that IS her character. Kawaii voice → brutal combat. |

### When to Use Humor

- **Purpose:** Pressure valve after tension. Character differentiation. Cultural worldbuilding.
- **Types:**
  - Slovak wordplay — "Šo" = shit in fox language (Ch1)
  - Japanese cultural humor — Mako rituals, Tami's wrong bow, "Kowai"
  - Tami's irreverence vs. Maks's stoicism
  - Sera's kawaii voice as unsettling comedy
- **Rule:** Humor never undermines stakes — it exists ALONGSIDE darkness, not instead of it.
- **Example from Ch1:** Tami thinks "Šo?" about Shoraven, while the city is under siege and her dead friends were burned at the square.

### When to Go Grimdark

- **Purpose:** Consequences carry weight. The world is real. Stakes are genuine.
- **Types:**
  - Institutional violence — public burnings, caste system, Blood Harvest by Archangels
  - Body horror — Maya crystallization, Glitch Rot, Blood Ritual self-harm
  - Moral compromise — Maks kills routinely, Tami pragmatically accepts violence
  - Psychological darkness — Elania's nihilism, 2,750 years of solitude
- **Rule:** Grimdark is never gratuitous — it always reveals character or advances theme.
- **Example from Ch3:** The Blood Ritual isn't torture porn — it's a soldier sacrificing his own body, because the math says there's no other way.

### Rule of Coexistence

The same chapter can contain both tones. Ch1 has:
1. Backstory of burnings (grimdark)
2. "Šo" wordplay (humor)
3. Mako tea ceremony (reverence)
4. "Kowai" ending (uncanny)

**Principle:** In real life, people laugh in dark times. Soldiers joke. Refugees laugh. Children play in ruins. This is what separates NULL VOID from pure grimdark (where everything is relentless) and from pure anime (where consequences reset).

## 4. Sandbox Philosophy

NULL VOID is not a closed story with a defined ending. It's a **living world** — a sandbox you can return to, expand, add new layers.

### Core Principles

- **The world works without Maks and Tami** — it lived its own life for 3,000 years. The legend of the world's end is just a legend. Maks isn't the "chosen one" — he's just a man who woke up. No god, no prophecy. The world doesn't need him. He needs to understand the world.
- **Nobody has plot armor** — If Maks died fighting the Paladins or in the Battle of Shoraven, Tami mourns him and moves on. She meets Links, they live together. The Great Upload probably doesn't happen — it depends on who gets the Antenna and what they use it for. The world doesn't revolve around one person. The Antenna is the MacGuffin, not Maks.
- **Lore > Plot** — The world is the main character. The story is just a window into the world.
- **Characters survive** — Maks's Upload isn't a necessary finale. Characters can go on.
- **Never-ending story** — The pentalogy is just the first arc. Not the end.

### Expandability

| Direction | Possibility |
|------|---------|
| **Return to Earth** | Cyberpunk version of the same universe. What happened after the Exodus? |
| **New continents** | Achilles is a super-Earth. The map shows 4 continents. How many are there in total? |
| **New eras** | Pre-Maks Achilles. Era of the Players. Inetis's centuries. |
| **New characters** | Every country, every city, every ship has stories. |
| **Different genre in the same world** | Detective fiction in Nevriss. Horror in Ynetis. Political thriller in Graw. |
| **What If lines** | Alternative versions of the same universe. What if things had turned out differently? |

### What If — Alternative Stories in the Same World

Sandbox means every "what if" is a legitimate story:

- **If Maks hadn't died on Earth:** Maks and Inetis found a dynasty after the Coordinator retires. No Achilles. No Spira. Political thriller on Earth.
- **If Maks died in Shoraven:** Tami + Links. The Antenna goes to someone else. The Upload may never happen.
- **If Inetis had woken Maks after 300 years:** A different Achilles — smaller, younger world. Maks and Inetis build civilization together. Elania grows up with both parents.
- **If Elania had never left Elysium:** A world without the Upload threat. Wraiths are the biggest problem. Sera has no master.

**What If as a narrative tool:** In Book 5, Elania uses What If directly as a weapon — she shows Maks a simulation of Kyiv where he meets Inetis as an ordinary woman. They go on a date. As mortals. This is the hardest temptation of the saga — not power, not paradise, but the ordinary life he always dreamed of.

None of the alternative storylines are "non-canonical" — they are windows into other versions of the same world. Each has the potential for its own story.

### Why Sandbox

Better than consuming mediocre isekai — create your own world. NULL VOID is a creative space that grows with the author. Every new thought, every new influence can be organically integrated into the existing lore, because the world is large enough and deep enough to absorb anything.

## 5. Elevator Pitch

### One Sentence

**SK:** *"Svet, kde sa modlitby kompilujú a duchovia sú len nanoboty, ktoré sa rozhodli prežiť."*

**EN:** *"A world where prayers compile and ghosts are just nanobots that chose to survive."*

### Longer Form (1 paragraph)

**SK:** Na planéte Achilles ľudia veria, že ovládajú mágiu. Neveria. Ich modlitby sú voice-activated skripty, ich pentagramy sú IDE, a ich duchovia sú nanoboty staré 3000 rokov, ktoré sa rozhodli prežiť. Keď sa vojak z Éry Hráčov zobudí z kryostázy, odhaľuje pravdu — a stojí proti vlastnej dcére, ktorá za 2750 rokov samoty dospela k záveru, že jedinou cestou je nahrať všetky vedomia do digitálneho prázdna.

**EN:** On the planet Achilles, people believe they wield magic. They don't. Their prayers are voice-activated scripts, their pentagrams are IDEs, and their ghosts are 3,000-year-old nanobots that chose to survive. When a soldier from the Era of the Players wakes from cryosleep, he uncovers the truth — and faces his own daughter, who after 2,750 years of solitude has concluded that the only path forward is uploading all consciousness into the digital void.
