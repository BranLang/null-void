## Races on Achilles

### 1. Homo Sapiens Sapiens (Humans / "Pureblood" / "The Old Ones")
**Slurs (from Varietas):** "Heretics" (the most widespread — a jab at their rejection of the Mother and Spira), "Pale Ones" (they look sickly — no fur, no color), "Oldbloods" (their blood is ancient, corrupted, full of dust instead of life), "Fossils" (they live forever but are obsolete — the past belongs to them, not the future).
**Origin:** The original colonists from Earth, Ex Inferis, and their direct descendants.

**Biology:** Thanks to cutting-edge nanotechnology from Earth — present in their bodies from birth — they do not age and are immune to disease. They can live for thousands of years, unless killed by violence or "Glitch" (which is why, after the crises and trauma of the past, they fear technology). They are the "elves" of this world.

**Status:** They are rare, but maintain powerful enclaves.
- **Neuropa**: Home of the "Old People" who remember Earth. Isolationists.
- **Graw (North)**: A militant human caste under Grond's rule.
- **Simira (Glass City)**: A decadent court surrounding Ishtar.
Most live in isolation as Archangels within their domains. Those who live among Varietas are seen as an untouchable elite, but are secretly despised for their immortality.
- **Apex** — a realm of Apes where the Emperor rules, surrounded by paladins.

### 1. Homo Sapiens Varietas (Varietas / Neo-Morphs)
**Slurs (from Humans):** "Hybrids" (the most widespread slur, commonly used), "Beast", "Half-breeds", "Toys", "Short-lived".

**Origin:** Descendants of genetically modified humans from Earth (originally for fashion/decadence).

**Biology:** They are mortal. They age and die (lifespan approximately 60–80 years). They are susceptible to disease and hunger. Their appearance is diverse — from subtle animal traits (eyes, teeth, fur) to pronounced deformities.
**Society:** They make up 99% of the population of the continent of Terra. They have their own kingdoms, tribes, languages, and rich folklore.
    - **Cats/Dogs/Wolves**: The most common races.
    - **Foxes (Vulpini)**: Extremely rare, considered extinct or mythical. Rumored to have a hidden homeland beyond the maps.

### 3. Androids (Maki)
**Origin:** The "Hephaestus" Expedition (a seed ship from 2098 AD). Originally an **international cooperation** (Europe, China, Japan).
- **Survival of the Fittest**: After the "Blood Lesson" (a massacre by Wraiths), almost exclusively **Japanese models** (J-Series) survived to the present day. Other model lines (European, Chinese) were destroyed.
    - **Exception**: There is one confirmed survivor from the **European Series** — a Mako named **Felix**. He wanders the world as an itinerant weaponsmith, crafting legendary "88s" (heavy cannons).
- **Culture**: Due to J-Series dominance, modern Maki prefer traditional Japanese aesthetics (katana blades, minimalism, a bow as a greeting).

**Etymology:** From the Latin *machina* -> *makina* -> **Maki**. Singular: **Mako**.

**Biology:** Biological machines (organic bodies, bio-computer brains). They lack emotions, fear, or ambition. They are governed by the Directive: "Survive. Build. Serve humanity."

**Appearance:** They often look like perfect, symmetrical humans. They are quiet and hyper-efficient.

---

### 1. Archangels (Ex Inferis)
The ruling caste of immortal Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Founded by the four original **Ex Inferis**, who returned aboard the ship **ARK-13 "Prometheus"** around the year **700 AY**.
- **Arrival and Salvation**: They found Achilles in ruins and Elania fighting a desperate battle against the Wraiths in the wreckage of central Elysia. Their intervention turned the tide.
- **Ideology**: The Archangels see themselves as the apex of evolution. Varietas are merely "short-lived cattle" and a source of nanobots. They view the Maki as useful "farmers" — their technology (airships, sewage systems) ensures a healthier and more numerous Varietas herd. More healthy Varietas = more quality nanobots (blood offerings) for the Archangels.
- **True Fear**: They fear only two things: **Wraiths** (which can damage the Citadel's systems) and **Glitch Rot**, which corrupts nanobots and renders them unusable.
- **Harvesting (The Collection)**: Archangel hunters track down Varietas with the "Gift of the Mother." The process is brutal — the Archangels drain the nanobots from their bodies, killing the victim and leaving behind only a "dried-out husk."
- **Consequence for Society**: Spira is viewed among the Varietas with hope but also extreme fear. Having abilities means becoming a target for the "Gods." This leads families to often hide their gifted children or suppress their abilities.
- **Rulers**:
    - **Samaell:** Shadow, secrecy, ancient technologies. **Dead** (killed by Maks in AY 3001).
    - **Grond:** War, industry, brute force. **Dead** (~AY 1200, Glitch Rot) — replaced by a dynasty of impostors in his Power Armor.
    - **Zaya (Ishtar):** Pleasure, drugs, propaganda/illusions. Lives on Simira in the Glass City.
    - **Elania:** The original leader, who acknowledged their supremacy in exchange for her people's survival. Serves as the "Gatekeeper." Lives on Neuropa.

### 2. "The Scattered" (Humans Among Varietas)
Remnants of the old Homo Sapiens Sapiens civilization who are not warlords.
- **Status:** They live in Varietas cities as respected elite (doctors, teachers, advisors).
- **Psychology:** Paralyzed by nostalgia and trauma. They witnessed the fall of the world. They are afraid to speak about the past. They are cynical, depressed "immortals."

### 3. Wandering Exorcists (The Wandering Exorcists)
Hardened mercenaries and veterans specializing in combat within infested zones. Not priests — "liquidators."
- **Role**: They cleanse pockets of **Glitch Rot** and "exorcise" **Wraiths** (by physically destroying the hardware). They use Linux commands and hack into wraiths.
- **Composition**: Desperate humans (more resistant to Glitch Rot) or Varietas. The occupation with the highest mortality rate.
- **Status**: They are immensely wealthy, but short-lived. Paid in pure gold.

### 4. Androids (Maki)
Unemotional engineers and builders.
- **Role:** Provide technical knowledge and build analog infrastructure (airships, high-precision analog devices).
- **Status:** Neutral, but respected.

### 5. Varietas
They live in the coastal kingdoms of the southern continent of Terra.
Nevriss, Beladiss, Nyau

## Spira — The "Spirit" of Varietas

### Name and Origin
**Spira** (from the original English *Spirit*, corrupted through 3,000 years of linguistic evolution) is the Varietas word for nanotechnology in the blood. To them, it is Spira — an invisible force, the Gift of the Mother.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Original word** | Spirit -> Sprit -> Spira |
| **Meaning for Varietas** | The power of Spira, the Mother's blessing |
| **Reality** | Concentration of nanobots in the blood (hereditary) |
| **Distribution** | Uneven — depends on genetics and caste |

### Manifestations of Spira
Individuals with a high concentration of nanobots in their blood can:
- **Elemental manipulation**: Fire, water, air, earth (in reality, nanobots manipulate molecules)
- **Telekinesis**: Moving objects at a distance (nanobots generate electromagnetic fields)
- **Enhanced regeneration**: Rapid healing, slowed aging
- **Extreme longevity**: The most powerful Purebloods live up to **50 winters** (~250 years)
- **Craft Spira**: The middle caste uses Spira for smithing, construction, and medicine

### Spira as Code (Metaphysics)
For Varietas, Spira is a mystical force, but in reality it functions as programming.
- **Clean IDE at Birth**: Every Varietas child is born with a "blank slate" (inactive nanobots). They have no innate abilities.
- **Configuration (Faith/Training)**: For Spira to work, each individual must "write their own code." Faith in the Mother serves as the syntax that gives commands their form.
- **Family Secrets (Heredity)**: Scripts and "spells" are passed down within families. A father teaches his son how to bend fire in exactly the way his own father did.
- **Church Libraries**: The most efficient and safest scripts are owned by the Church of the All-Knowing Mother. Only the elite have access to these "optimized algorithms." Some basic prayers (commands) are "Open Source," but experimenting with your own code is considered heresy and is extremely dangerous due to memory overflow.
- **Heretical Inscriptions (Open Source Spira)**: Scattered across the world are inscriptions carved into stone or etched into wood — the work of **ancient heretics** from the time when Inetis still personally taught powerful scripts. These scripts were originally freely available, but the Church gradually regulated, banned, and declared them dangerous. The heretics — those who remembered them — carved them into stone and wood so they would survive. Today they are forgotten and forbidden. The Church actively destroys the inscriptions, but in remote areas they still endure. Anyone who finds such an "incantation" gains a new, powerful script for their IDE. Rare specimens are the subject of treasure hunts — and Inquisitions.

### Gen 1 vs. Varietas — Two Languages of Spira
The contrast between nanotechnology generations defines the entire world:
- **Gen 1 (Maks/Humans)**: Military nanotechnology controlled directly — English Linux commands, CLI interface, raw data streams. When Maks issues a command to his drones, it sounds like an incomprehensible prayer in a foreign tongue. To Varietas, his words are an *alien incantation* — terrifying and powerful.
- **Varietas (Haiku Syntax)**: Inetis disguised the Spira code within Japanese Haiku. Prayers to the Mother are actually macros and scripts — rhythmic, poetic commands that activate nanobots. A Varietas recites a Haiku to invoke a "spell." The Church teaches that poetry is the language of the Mother. The truth is that it is a programming language.
- **Why It Works**: Gen 1 nanotech responds to English CLI commands (Old Speech). Varietas nanotech (designed by Inetis) responds to Haiku syntax. Both systems are programming — just in different languages. When Maks and a Varietas meet in battle, it looks like a clash of two entirely different "schools" — as if one were casting spells in Latin and the other in Japanese.

### WaSpira (War Spira)
A militant application of Spira, focused on destruction and combat.
- **Origin**: Does not come from peaceful Nevriss, but from the wild Eastern kingdoms.
- **Users**: Mercenaries. These warriors have intricate tattoos on their bodies (circuit schematics) that serve as external macros for rapid invocation of offensive spells.


### The Enlightened vs. Believers
Two fundamental approaches to Spira define the world:
- **Believing Varietas**: They are convinced that only strong faith in the Mother enables control of Spira. And they are partially right — Inetis designed the IDE system so that Spira's "syntax" requires mental discipline and rituals that religion naturally provides.
- **The Enlightened (Unblessed Humans/Maks)**: Humans like Maks, who were not blessed by Inetis, see religion as a psychological weapon of mass control. Maks understands Spira as pure technology and teaches Tami the same approach — even though he himself has no Spira.
- **Blessed Ones (Blessed Ones)**: Descendants of Inetis's human team who were blessed by her touch alongside the early Varietas. They live on the **southern coast of Terra** in communities. They have Spira like Varietas but retained pure human bodies.
- **Tami (Exception)**: One of the few Varietas who does not believe in the Mother. Thanks to Maks's scientific mentorship, she can utilize Spira at 200% — she is not bound by Church dogma and experiments freely. The Church considers her a heretic.

### Usage in Speech
- *"She has strong Spira"* = she has many nanobots in her blood
- *"His Spira is pure"* = a pureblood with high concentration
- *"The Spira in him grows quiet"* = losing strength / dying
- *"Without Spira"* = low caste, no Spira
- *"The Mother's Spira flows through you"* = a blessing / greeting

## Caste System (Nevriss)

### Visual Scale — From Human to Animal

Varietas form a **spectrum** between human and animal appearance. The caste system reflects this spectrum:

| Visual Type | Caste | Appearance |
|------------|-------|------------|
| **Neko** | Pursang | Human body + subtle animal traits (ears, eyes, teeth, tail). At first glance, almost human. |
| **Mid-spectrum** | Mezra | Human body with more pronounced animal traits — ears, eyes, claws, sometimes light fur. Still predominantly human. |
| **Anthropomorphic** | Ghorki | Strong animal traits — full fur, muzzles, scales, beaks. Anthropomorphic animals or intelligent beasts. |

> **Rule:** The more "human" the appearance, the stronger the Spira. This is not coincidence — Inetis designed Spira v2.0 for the human genome. Pursang with the highest proportion of human DNA have the greatest nanobots compatibility.

### Overview

| Caste | Description | Spira | Longevity |
|-------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Purebloods** *(Pursang)* | Elite families, generations of arranged unions. **Appearance:** Neko — human with subtle animal traits (ears, eyes, teeth) | Extreme | Up to 50 winters (~250 years) |
| **Middle caste** *(Mezra)* | Artisans, merchants, soldiers. **Appearance:** Mid-spectrum — human with more pronounced animal traits (ears, eyes, claws). | Moderate | 15–25 winters (~75–125 years) |
| **Low caste** *(Ghorki)* | Varietas without Spira. **Appearance:** Anthropomorphic — strong animal traits (fur, muzzles, tails), anthropomorphic animals. | None/minimal | 10–15 winters (~50–75 years) |

### Purebloods *(Pursang)*
The top of the pyramid. Families that have climbed to the peak over generations through arranged unions.

- **Genetics**: Maximum human DNA -> maximum compatibility with nanobots. Varietas are **modified humans** (human genome base + animal traits), which is why Spira v2.0 works — it was designed for human biology.
- **Spira**: Control elements, telekinesis, extreme regeneration
- **Longevity**: Up to 50 winters (some legendary individuals even more)
- **Position**: High Priestesses, generals, guild leaders, aristocracy
- **Appearance**: They look "most human" — fewer animal traits, which correlates with the strongest Spira
- **Arranged Unions**: Marriages are political agreements between families, aimed at strengthening Spira in offspring

### Middle Caste *(Mezra)*
The backbone of society. Artisans, merchants, soldiers with craft Spira.

- **Genetics**: Mixed — enough human DNA to activate nanobots, but with more pronounced animal traits
- **Spira**: Used for craft and labor:
  - **Smiths**: Fire Spira for smelting and shaping metals
  - **Builders**: Earth Spira for manipulating stone
  - **Healers**: Water Spira for mending wounds
  - **Soldiers**: Basic telekinesis, body enhancement
- **Longevity**: 15–25 winters (~75–125 years)
- **Position**: Middle class — they have rights, property, but not power
- **Appearance**: Predominantly human. Animal traits are subtle — cat-like eyes, pointed ears, claws instead of nails. They never have fur on their face or an animal head.

### Low Caste *(Ghorki)* — Chimeras
**Ghorki are not Varietas.** They are **Chimeras** — animals genetically modified toward human intelligence (the opposite direction from Varietas). Their base genome is **animal**, not human.

- **Genetics**: Minimal or no human DNA -> nanobots do not function. Their physiology is too different from human
- **Spira**: None or virtually none
- **Reason**: Inetis designed Spira v2.0 for the **human** genome (Varietas are modified humans). Chimeras (modified animals) have an entirely different biological foundation — Inetis did not have time to solve compatibility in The Core, because access to the simulation was extremely demanding
- **Intelligence**: Many Chimeras possess near-human intelligence — they speak, think, feel. But some are not even bipedal (e.g., enormous wolves that speak and are proud, but have no hands)
- **Longevity**: 10–15 winters (~50–75 years)
- **Position**: Laborers, porters, servants. In Nevriss they are free (the Cult of the Mother forbids slavery), but in practice they are the poorest
- **Appearance**: Strongly animal — full fur, scales, beaks, wings. Some look like anthropomorphic animals, others like intelligent beasts in their original animal form

### Slavery — North vs. South

| | Nevriss (South) | Graw (North) |
|---|-----------------|--------------|
| **Slavery** | **Forbidden** — faith in the Loving Mother | **Legal** — the weak serve the strong |
| **Ghorki** | Free, but poor | Slaves, property |
| **Justification** | "All children of the Mother are equal" | "Strength is virtue, weakness is sin" |
| **Reality** | De facto inequality — Ghorki are free but without Spira they hold no power | Open brutality |

> **In Nevriss there is no slavery — but there is no equality either.** Ghorki are formally free. The Cult of the Mother teaches that "all children of the Mother are equal under her gaze." In practice, however, without Spira they have no access to power, guilds, or politics. They are free laborers, not slaves — but the difference is sometimes only that no one holds their chain.

---

## Social Dynamics & Conflict

### 1. Envy and Hatred (Mortality vs. Eternity)
This is the core tension. Varietas build, multiply, and die within a single generation. Humans watch it all for centuries, unchanging and arrogant. Varietas see humans as selfish gods who refuse to share the gift of eternity.

**Internal Racism:** Varietas are also racist among themselves — and toward Chimeras. The caste system is based on proximity to the human genome: Purebloods (Pursang) with the strongest Spira look down on Chimeras (Ghorki) without Spira. Chimeras are modified animals with near-human intelligence, but their animal genome prevents compatibility with Spira. Varietas (modified humans) perceive them as "lesser," even though many Chimeras are equally intelligent. It is cruel, because these beings did not choose their genetics.

### 2. Folklore vs. Truth
- **Truth:** Humans know that the world was once a sci-fi civilization destroyed by AI. They stay silent about it out of fear.
- **Varietas Folklore:** They believe in "Mother Inetis" who gave them gifts (Spira) and believe humans are fallen angels. Fundamentalists reject scientific truth.

### 3. Logic vs. Emotion vs. Stagnation
The Synths introduced a third side to the conflict.
- **Archangels (Stagnation):** They want to maintain the status quo and their decaying bodies. The Maki are uncontrollable parasites to them (they cannot be drained).
- **Varietas (Emotion):** They yearn for progress and freedom. The Maki are their driving engine.
- **Maki (Pure Logic):** They build because it is their programming. Their presence gives Varietas the technology to circumvent Archangel supremacy (e.g., airships).

### 4. Prejudice vs. Experience (Identity Crisis)
The deepest psychological conflict of the world.
- **Truth in Darkness**: Maks's example shows that respect can be built even between mortal enemies when visual perception is suppressed.
- **Consequence of Revelation**: When prejudice meets positive personal experience (e.g., Maks discovers that his savior is a Varietas), identity shatters. The individual either accepts the new reality or retreats into even more aggressive hatred to protect their old worldview.

### 5. Achilles: The Myth of Fortress vs. The Reality of Rust
The planet's name reflects the world's greatest irony.
- **Human Myth**: For those who came from Earth, Achilles was to be the "Unbreakable Shield" and a staging ground for a return home.
- **Varietas Reality**: For the native-born, it is just a name from fairy tales. They see the planet as a "tomb of rust and bones." To them, Achilles does not mean a hero, but a place where hope came to die.
- **Achilles' Heel**: The world became the embodiment of human weakness — the cowardice of an elite that, instead of building an army to return to Earth, succumbed to its own godhood and decadence.

---

## Economy and Daily Life

### The Gold Economy
In a world without digital transactions (because of the Wraiths), gold has become the only universal currency.
- **Stability**: Gold is chemically stable, unaffected by Glitch Rot, and rare.
- **Blood Gold**: The Archangels pay Exorcists in ancient gold from ARK-13 for dangerous missions in the ruins. This makes them the wealthiest individuals outside the Citadels.

### Guild System (Shoraven / Nevriss)
Shoraven is the largest trade hub on the continent. It operates on a guild system, free trade, and an exchange.

#### Guilds
Guilds are self-governing organizations of artisans, merchants, and professionals. Each guild has its own council, rules, and hall.

| Guild | Domain | Dominant Caste |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Smiths' Guild** | Weapons, tools, mechanics | Mezra (fire Spira) |
| **Healers' Guild** | Medicine, alchemy | Mezra / Pursang (water Spira) |
| **Builders' Guild** | Architecture, fortifications | Mezra (earth Spira) |
| **Merchants' Guild** | Trade, transport, supply | All castes |
| **Aeronauts' Guild** | Airships, navigation | Mezra |
| **Horologists' Guild** | Precision mechanics, Silent Technology | Mezra + Maki |

- **Membership**: Requires an exam, an apprenticeship period, and a fee. Ghorki can become members of the Merchants' Guild (which does not require Spira), but are a rarity in other guilds.
- **Political Power**: Guildmasters sit on the city's Trade Council — a parallel power alongside the Church. The Church rules over spirits; the guilds rule over coin.
- **Wartime**: During war, the guilds supply the army and receive special contracts. The Smiths' Guild is the wealthiest organization in the city during a siege.

#### Free Trade and the Exchange
- **Shoraven Exchange** *(Shobo)*: An open market at the center of the port, where commodities are traded — metals, grain, spices, Spira crystals (concentrated nanotech in mineral form), weapons.
- **Free Trade**: Unlike Graw (where the state/Grond controls commerce), Nevriss operates on a free market. Anyone can trade — from a Pursang aristocrat to a Ghorki street vendor.
- **Contracts**: Paper contracts sealed with a guild stamp. Breach of contract is punished by exile from the guild — in practice, economic death.
- **Smuggling**: Where there is free trade, there is also a black market. Underground trade in stolen relics, banned weapons, and — in secret — information about Spira and underground tunnels.

### Transportation
1. **Airships:** The fastest and safest form of transport. They became commonplace after the arrival of the **Maki** (AY 2212), who brought the technical knowledge to build them. Preferred over ships due to frequent earthquakes and tsunamis that destroy ports and sink vessels. Mostly powered by biodiesel or ethanol.
2. **Biplanes:** Fast but rare — the engines require high precision and there is no mass production. Powered by biodiesel or biogasoline. Mostly combat and reconnaissance craft.
3. **Seafaring Vessels:** A cheaper but riskier alternative. Once the primary form of transport (Nevriss was a maritime empire), ships are now considered dangerous and unreliable. Tsunamis and underwater earthquakes make maritime trade a gamble. Used by those who cannot afford airships, or by smugglers.
4. **River Steamers:** Cargo transport along rivers — relatively safe (rivers do not have tsunamis).
5. **Genetically Modified Animals:** Dogs (replacing horses) and cats. All are intelligent and capable of speech.
6. **Trains (Terra):** Steam and diesel trains exist on Terra — primitive but functional. Rails suffer from earthquakes — maintenance is constant. Mainly on routes between major cities (Nevriss, Beladiss, Nyau).
7. **Maglev Trains (Simira):** The domain of **Ishtar/Zaya** (Glass City) and **Apes** possesses futuristic maglevs — technologically far beyond anything on Terra. To Varietas, they would look like Spira.

---

## Linguistic Landscape (Babylon 2700)
Isolation and the collapse of technology shattered a unified language into several layers:

- **Old Speech (Ancient / Old English)**: The language of the Ex Inferis and the original humans from Earth. To modern inhabitants it sounds archaic and incomprehensible.
- **RP English (Received Pronunciation)**: The standard language of the Maki. Formal, unemotional, and cold. Serves as the primary bridge for those emerging from stasis.
- **Neo-Terran**: A mutated English influenced by Varietas dialects. The language of trade and common folk.
- **Wildspeak (Babble)**: Various dialects and slang of the Varietas, often built on sounds and gestures.

---

## Traditions and Culture

### Exorcist "Prayers" (CLI Language)
- Garbled commands from the Unix/Linux command line that phonetically function as voice codes for resetting nanodrones.
- Example: `sudo kill -9` -> **"Suudokil"**.
- Meaning: Ritual protection against nanotechnological threats.

### Ritual Patterns
- Drawing pentagrams or circuits with **conductive paste**.
- In reality, these close circuits and activate ancient safety or maintenance procedures.

---

## Factions (Lore Register)

### Cults of the Mother and the Doctrine of the Four Comings
The foundational theology of the Varietas in Nevriss believes in the **Holy Trinity**: the Mother (Creator), the Daughter (Magic/Spira), and the Sleeper (End/Judgment). They existed before time itself.

**History is divided into the Comings:**
1.  **The First Coming (The Seed)**: The first settlers (Humans and Varietas) from the stars. Heralds of life.
2.  **The Second Coming (The Fire)**: **Ex Inferis (Archangels)**. They brought power, but also pride and war. A trial of faith.
3.  **The Third Coming (The Silence)**: **Maki (Synthetic Engineers)**. They brought technology and the truth about "silence." They teach that words are meaningless — only actions matter.
4.  **The Fourth Coming (The Void)**: **The Sleeper**. A myth of the End Times. It will come when the world is too corrupt, to "shut it down" or "restart it." It is not a savior — it is **The End**.

The Cult of the Mother teaches that the Sleeper is merely a metaphor. But ancient sects and archaeologists (like Kito) know that the prophecy is a technical manual.
- **Archangels**: Four immortal rulers/domains (Samaell†, Grond†, Zaya/Ishtar, Elania).
- **Exorcists / Technomancers**: A secret order of liquidators who fight Glitch Rot and Wraiths.
- **Ynetis Colonists**: The first wave of settlers; their fall forms the foundation of modern myths.
- **Earth Regime**: The totalitarian structure of Earth before its fall.

---

## Religions and Cults

### Cult of the All-Knowing Mother (Decentralized Faith)
The Cult of the Mother is the dominant religion in the south and east of the continent of Terra. It is not, however, centrally governed like the Catholic Church. It is more of a federation of sister churches that share core dogmas but differ in their interpretation of "the role of men" and mythology.

#### 1. Nevriss (South) — Reformed Church
**"All children are equal."**
- **Theology:** Monotheism. They worship only the Mother. The figure of the "Father" or "Sleeper" has been deliberately erased or marginalized from mythology.
- **Reason (Lore):** A hundred years ago, the **Bloody Male Revolts** erupted in Nevriss. The old dogma (similar to the one in Beladiss) claimed that men carry the "Sin of the Father." This led to oppression. After the revolution, the Council of High Priestesses reformed the faith — the Sleeper was stricken from sermons so that men would be granted souls and rights. Today, Nevriss is the most liberal theocracy.
- **Shoraven:** The main temple is the center of this reformed branch.
- **The Blessed Mother (Secret):** The head of the Council of High Priestesses is **Mormiel** — the 4th Archangel from ARK-13, the only Varietas from the ship. The public perceives the Blessed Mother as a lineage of holy women. Roughly every ~100 years, the **Rite of Succession** takes place: the departing Mother selects a young maiden from the people, behind closed doors dissolves and absorbs her via nanotechnology, assumes her likeness — and the "new Mother" confirms that the old one transformed into light and that Inetis called her to her side. Over ~2,300 years, Mormiel has passed through ~23 identities. The Rite is the Church's holiest ceremony and no one has ever questioned it. By night she prowls the streets of Nevriss City as a predator. Details in [characters/Mormiel.md](../characters/Mormiel.md).

#### 2. Beladiss (East) — Orthodox Dualism
**"The Mother gives life, the Father brings death."**
- **Theology:** Dualism. The world is a battle between the Mother (the All-Encompassing) and the Father (the Sleeper).
- **The Father as Evil:** In their lore, the Father is the embodiment of evil, destruction, and cold logic that obliterated the old world.
- **Status of Men:** In Beladiss, men are considered "vessels of sin." They have restricted rights, cannot own land, and cannot hold office. They are de facto second-class citizens who must "redeem themselves" through hard labor.
- **Relations with Nevriss:** Beladiss considers Nevriss "soft" and heretical for allowing men to rule within the guilds.

**Relic (Nevriss):** Hidden in the vaults beneath the Main Temple in Shoraven is the **Antenna** — in the eyes of believers, the holiest relic ("the Holy Antenna" or "Scepter of the Mother").

> **Reality:** It is a communications antenna from the ship **NULL VOID** (FTL prototype). When Inetis decomposed the entire ship into nanodrones, the Antenna glitched and refused reconfiguration — the only part of the ship that remained in its original state. Its original purpose was to control "Wraiths" (goo swarms — maintenance nanobots) via sub-space frequencies.
>
> **Inetis's Tool:** Using the Antenna, Inetis built all of Elysium. For large nanobot swarms, the Antenna is needed as an amplifier — without it, an individual can only control a small number of nanodrones. The Antenna was her weapon, her staff, her symbol. **Statues of Inetis** across the continent depict her with a staff in hand — that is the Antenna. Thanks to it, she could freely travel between Nevriss and Elysium even when the city was lost to everyone else.
>
> **Why Everyone Wants It:** The Antenna is the only object on the planet capable of controlling large nanobot swarms. In the context of a world where goo swarms devour cities, it is the most powerful tool on the planet. **The Archangels**, **the Church**, **Grond**, **Apes** — all major players know about it and all of them want it.
>
> **Maks's Interface:** Maks (as a former military operator) is the only being on Achilles with a compatible interface to use it. For him, it is not Spira. It is hardware.

### Cult of the Immortal Grond (North — Graw)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Deity** | Grond ("The Immortal Ruler") |
| **Center** | The Iron Citadel |
| **Rule** | "Immortal Grond" (a dynasty in Power Armor) |
| **Character** | Militant, expansionist |

**Secret (known only to a tight inner circle):**
- The true Grond (Ex Inferis) died of Glitch Rot around AY 1200
- His Power Armor was claimed by one of the generals
- Each new "Grond" is just a man in the armor — no one sees the face beneath the helmet
- The dynasty of impostors has continued for ~1,800 years

**Doctrines:**
- Grond is an immortal god-soldier
- Strength is virtue, weakness is sin
- The South are "unbelievers" and "heretics"

### Religious Conflict (AY ~3013)

**Cause of the War:**
1. **A 5-year winter** devastated the North's supplies
2. **Poor planning** led to famine
3. **Nevriss refuses to trade** with "unbelievers"
4. **Grond's solution**: Military expansion

**End-times Prophecies:**
- The Cult of the Mother believes the Antenna is a "sign of the end"
- The myth of **the Sleeper** = the Devil, antagonist of the Mother, a being of the end
- When "the Sleeper awakens," judgment day arrives

---

## The Secret of the Grond Dynasty

### The True Grond (AY 700–1200)
- One of the four original Archangels (Ex Inferis from Earth)
- Arrived on ARK-13 "Prometheus"
- **Appearance**: Muscular, rugged, like The Rock / Conan
