## Appearance

**Physical:**
- **Human.** No fox ears, no elongated face, no amber eyes. Pure Homo Sapiens.
- Medium height, sinewy — a body shaped by millennia of travel, not years
- Strikingly **blue eyes** — unforgettable, bright, youthful. A marker of terrestrial origin.
- A face people remembered — not beautiful, but **unforgettable**. Youthful even after millennia.
- Hands covered in scars — from artifacts, traps, collapsed ceilings, millennia of adventures

**Iconic hat:**
- Wore a **tricorn hat** — a style as if he'd been plucked from a history textbook
- The hat concealed his missing ears (in a world where most people have animal ears, having none is suspicious)
- It became his trademark — **in Beladiss he even started a fashion trend**
- Captains began dressing in uniforms and hats inspired by Renn
- For Renn it was a practical accessory. For the world it was an icon.

**Movements:**
- Silent, deliberate — he moved through ruins like a ghost
- After 3000 years his movements were subconsciously perfect — not supernaturally fast (Gen 1 had degraded), but precise from sheer experience
- In his final decades visibly slower — weakened without vampirism

**Voice:**
- Quiet, deep, few words
- Spoke only when he had something to say
- Talked more to Felix than to anyone — the machine was his last true friend
- When he spoke of the past — his voice softened. He never spoke of it.

## Backstory

### Earth and ARK-11 (EY ~2100-2150)

- Renn was a **civilian** — one of ~100 "tourists, teachers, doctors" aboard ARK-11
- An ordinary person, not a soldier or a scientist
- A young man with blue eyes and an unforgettable face
- On Earth he had Gen 1 nanobots (v1.0) — standard issue for citizens of the Era of the Players
- Departed on ARK-11 heading for Kepler 452b (Achilles)
- Same generation as Sera

### Elysium (AY 0-700)

- Lives in the colony, helps build civilization
- When Glitch Rot begins (~AY 300), Renn survives in the shadow of the Core
- 400 years of decay, death, disintegration — Renn watches Elysium fall apart
- When Inetis emerges from the Core (~AY 700), Renn is among the **handful of survivors**
- Receives **Gen 2 (Spira) blessing** by touch — one of the "First Blessed"
- Now carries dual tech: Gen 1 (degrading) + Gen 2 (Spira)

### Core Team Inetis (AY ~700-850)

- Member of the ~20-person team that accompanies Inetis from Elysium to the mainland
- **Fellow members**: Sera (Japanese veteran), later Mormiel (after the arrival of ARK-13 ~AY 700)
- **Missions to the colony of Neverice (Nevriss)**: carried supplies, helped before the winters
- Inetis migrated between Elysium and the mainland; Renn traveled with her
- They helped however they could — **built schools, hospitals**, carried food and other supplies
- **Renn built a relationship with the foxes** (Vulpini) during these visits — they respected him, he respected them
- They were not a couple — just friends. Inetis was burdened, carrying the weight of the world. Renn was quiet, dependable.

### The Great Battle and the Farewell (AY ~850)

**The Battle:**
- The foxes (Vulpini) were decimated — they had been the best strategists and Spira programmers
- After the battle at Atra Narrows, Renn decides: enough wars between humans and Varietas
- He wants to help the surviving fox families build a new city

**Inetis's secret:**
- Inetis gives the foxes **secret coordinates** — a place where an international expedition of synthetic builders (Maki, the Third Arrival) was supposed to land
- Renn volunteers to escort the surviving fox families through the dangerous Wilds to the east
- He could not imagine them surviving the journey alone — most of their warriors had fallen in the battle

**Inetis goes with them:**
- Some legends say Inetis went on her final journey alone
- **In truth she went with the foxes and Renn** — to Kito
- Along the way her condition worsened — Glitch Rot was advancing, she refused treatment
- She sent Renn and the foxes ahead

**The Cave of Ela:**
- Inetis showed Renn the place where she had once lived — **the Cave of Ela** (Cave of Beginning)
- **Shock of the flora**: during the 700+ years of her absence, **mushroom trees** had grown here, luminescent plants glowed at night... Genetically modified plants from a garden she had started out of boredom had seeded a vast independent ecosystem
- Inetis told Renn and the foxes she was just tired and needed to be alone for a while

**Renn knows the truth:**
- He saw the ruin of Elysium. He saw bit rot. He knows what awaits Inetis.
- **He drew himself a map** — so he would not forget the way back. One day he would return and bury his friend.
- But he never did.
- He tells himself that Inetis is still alive.
- **He does not have the courage to find her bones.**

---

## Founding of Kito (AY ~850-950)

- Renn leads the foxes to Inetis's coordinates
- They found the city of **Kitana** (later Kitsune, later Kito)
- A waiting place for the Third Arrival — where the Maki are supposed to land
- Renn becomes the unofficial leader
- The foxes have the Gift of the Mother (Spira), Renn does too — together they build a beautiful city
- Fox kits are born — the community grows

**First wife:**
- After ~100 years, Renn's first wife (a fox) dies — of old age
- They had no children — **Renn never wanted children**
- He did not want to watch them die of old age while he lived on
- He fell into depression
- He left Kito — became a wandering adventurer

---

## Wanderer (AY ~950-2900)

### Journeys across the world

- **He had no plan.** He never knew how to live — only how to travel. To keep going. To observe.
- Explored the north: **Graw** (wolf nations), the ice plains
- Explored the south: the **Apes jungle**, even lived in the **Glass City of Ishtar**
- He crossed all of Terra — not as a participant of history, but as an **observer and adventurer**
- History happened around him, not because of him. He was not at the founding of Nyau. He was not at the rise of the Nevriss Empire. He just passed through cities that were changing.
- Occasionally stopped by Kito — to check how life was going there
- **Had no enemies, had no ambitions** — only a great secret and an empty place in his chest

### Renn and Mormiel (~AY 1000-1500)

- During the golden age of the Nevriss Empire he traveled to her court
- **Met Mormiel** — she was not yet High Priestess, but she was one of the most influential people in the city
- Two lonely immortals from Earth — reminiscing about the old days
- **Physical relationship** — not love, more like warmth between two people who know too much about the world
- Intimacy born of need, not passion. It shifted over the centuries — sometimes closer, sometimes distant.
- **Mormiel taught Renn vampirism** — his Gen 1 was degrading, he needed maintenance
- Together they prowled the streets at night and hunted — two predators in one city
- **It gave rise to legends** — urban tales of shadows in the night

**Departure:**
- Renn saw the situation was unsustainable — there was no room for two hunters in one city
- **The parting was not dramatic** — he simply packed up one day and left. Mormiel expected it.
- On his wanderings he kept himself alive through vampirism and earned money by finding old artifacts

### The Great Flood (~AY 1500-1600)

- Megatsunamis destroy the Nevriss Empire
- Artifacts that the flood washed out of Elysium onto the shores became Renn's source of income
- A wandering techno-vampire — like Samaell, only quieter

### Meeting Samaell (~AY 1800)

- Renn met Samaell on the road
- Samaell told him he was searching for Inetis — he believed she held a cure for bit rot
- **Renn told him the truth**: even if she had one, he is forever cursed just like himself. No cure exists.
- After that conversation Samaell lost all hope — but he never stopped searching for Inetis
- Renn did not reveal the cave's location — he protected Inetis's remains

### Arrival of the Maki (AY 2212) — Third Arrival and the Blood Lesson

- Renn was there — he had waited **1300 years** for their arrival in Kito
- The Maki landed aboard the ship **Hephaestus** — thousands of synthetic androids, an international crew (EU, CN, JP)
- Kitsune welcomed them — a city of millions, full of foxes who had been waiting for the "Messengers of the Mother"
- **The Blood Lesson**: The Maki activated a fusion reactor to supply power. The signal attracted a **massive cyclone of Wraiths** from Elysium — a swarm that destroyed everything in its path. It came, massacred the Maki and part of the city, then returned. But not all Wraiths left — **a great deal of dust remained in Terra's atmosphere**. From that day on, no one dares to switch on a strong electrical current — whenever someone tries, bad things happen.
- The cyclone was also seen over **Nyau**, but did not harm it — there was no electrical signal. For the people of Nyau it was the day the sun went dark.
- Only **Series-J** survived (and unit 734 — Felix, Series E), because they were working deep underground
- Kitsune was devastated — the city of millions was reduced to ruins. But **several thousand foxes survived** and continued living in the wreckage
- But even the Arrival of the Maki did not fulfill Renn — something in his life was still missing
- He changed identity. Continued traveling.

### Further centuries (AY 2212-2900)

- Changed identities, occasionally settled down — but never for long
- **He did not know how to live.** He knew how to walk. He knew how to search. He did not know how to stay.
- Needed victims (vampirism) once every few months — he would slip away occasionally
- Never had children. Never. He had no reason — and no courage.
- Occasionally stopped by Kito — to check on the foxes and Felix, who remained in the ruins

---

## Return and Fatherhood (AY ~2900-3000)

### Return to Kito (~AY 2900)

- After centuries of wandering he decides to return permanently — to the ruins where he spent his best years
- Kito is a shadow of what it once was — after the Blood Lesson (AY 2212) the city never fully recovered
- He finds **Felix** — an old friend, still faithful to his Directive, still in the ruins
- **Felix and Renn** — both from Earth, both ancient. Felix is from Hephaestus (Maki Series E, AY 2212), understands the context. He knows who Renn is. Has known him since the Third Arrival.
- He decides to settle permanently in Kito

### Tami (AY 2993)

- **For the first time in ~2000 years he takes a wife** — a Vulpini woman
- **For the first time in his life he has a child**: Tami
- After millennia of refusing fatherhood — he finally dares
- Something in him broke — or healed — when he first held his daughter in his arms

### Death of the mother (~AY 2994)

- Tami's mother (100% Vulpini) knew about Renn's condition — his Gen 1 was degrading
- She willingly offered him Spira — "love as medicine"
- One day Renn went too far — drained too much. He killed her.
- Not intentionally — but the result is the same
- Tami was 1 year old. She remembers nothing.
- **Renn never practiced vampirism again** — he would rather degrade and slowly die than risk it again
- He lived his last 6 years with guilt

---

## The Ancient Map — A Sign (~AY 2995)

- At a black-market antique shop he discovers an old, weathered map for a few coins
- He recognizes **his own handwriting, his own symbols** — he drew it ~2000 years ago, when he was saying farewell to Inetis
- The map was lost somewhere on his travels — it passed through dozens of hands before ending up in the antique shop
- **A sign.** After millennia the map returned to him.
- **Renn finally found light... and courage.**
- He decides: he will take Tami on an adventure trip. He will fulfill an old promise. He will bury his friend.
- He packs, prepares Makita, Felix checks the engines
- The journey heads east through the Wilds toward the Cave of Ela

---

## Death (AY 3000)

### The Ambush

- **Pirates Vix and Kael were following them** — there were whispers on the black market about "a fox-man with an ancient map"
- Renn is not careful — he is **happy**, after millennia he is finally going to fulfill his promise
- He watches Tami, not his surroundings
- So weakened (6 years without vampirism) that he cannot defend himself
- They ambush him near Kito

### Death on the Road of Courage

- Chronologically ~3000+ years, biologically looks ~40
- **He dies on the road where he finally found courage**
- An old promise unfulfilled — the map was stolen from him
- The pirates steal the map, Makita, and capture 7-year-old Tami
- Felix was not in the ruins (he was out scavenging for parts)

### Renn's Legacy for Tami

- **Makita** — the finest ship on Terra (Spira drive, unlimited range)
- **Endless gold** in the ruins of Kito — artifacts, treasures from millennia of seeking
- **Felix** — personal mechanic, uncle, protector
- **That is why Tami is rich as a princess** — not from piracy, but from her father's millennial inheritance
- **The Map** — a scrap of paper that cost him his life and set the entire NULL VOID story in motion

---

## Personality

### Core
- **Quiet** — after 3000 years words had lost most of their meaning
- **Stubborn** — once he decided, nothing could deter him. Not even 2000 years.
- **A civilian at heart** — he was never a soldier, never a hero. Just a person who did the right things.
- **Gentle** — beneath millennia of shell was a father who loved his daughter above all else
- **Cowardly in one thing** — he never found the courage to go bury Inetis. Until the very end.
- **Loyal** — when he chose someone, he stayed with them. The foxes, Felix, Tami.

### Contrasts
- **Vs Maks**: Maks is a soldier, a general, a strategist. Renn was a civilian, an adventurer, an observer. Both loved Tami — each differently. Maks taught her to fight. Renn taught her to live.
- **Vs Sera**: Both from the Core Team of Inetis, both immortals from Earth. Sera is disciplined, pragmatic, a veteran. Renn was softer, more human, more fragile.
- **Vs Mormiel**: Both from Earth, both predators (vampirism). Mormiel enjoys it. Renn did it with revulsion — and eventually stopped, even though he knew it would kill him.
- **Vs Felix**: Renn was blood and instinct. Felix was logic and protocol. They complemented each other perfectly.

## Relationships

### Inetis (Deceased — Friend)
- They knew each other 150+ years in the Core Team
- They were not a couple — just a deep friendship between a tormented genius and a quiet civilian
- Inetis trusted him — that is why she entrusted him with escorting the foxes
- **Renn's greatest promise**: to return and bury her. He fulfilled it in his heart, but not with his feet.

### Sera (Alive — Former teammate)
- Together in the Core Team of Inetis for 150+ years
- Sera knows Renn's blue eyes — unforgettable
- In certain circles Renn was a legend — Sera knows exactly who he was
- **When Sera meets Tami** — she will see the blue eyes and understand

### Mormiel (Alive — Former partner)
- Physical relationship during the golden age of Nevriss (~AY 1000-1500)
- Two lonely immortals seeking warmth, not love
- Mormiel taught him vampirism — together they hunted
- Renn left when he saw Mormiel changing — ambitions, power, the church
- **When Mormiel sees Tami** — she will recognize Renn's eyes. A new layer of the Ritual.

### Felix (Alive — Last friend)
- Both from Earth (though Felix is a Mako, not a human)
- Felix knows everything — who Renn was, where he came from, what he experienced
- **He stays silent.** Why? Perhaps Renn asked him to. Perhaps he is waiting for the right moment. TBD.

### Tami (Daughter)
- The only child Renn ever had — after 3000 years of refusal
- He taught her to survive — not to fight (that was Maks), but to observe, to track, to make decisions
- **Tami suspects** from Felix's hints that her father was not entirely ordinary — but she does not have the full picture

### Tami's mother (Deceased — Wife)
- 100% Vulpini — a fox woman, beautiful, quiet
- She knew about Renn's condition; she willingly helped him
- Died when Tami was 1 year old — Renn killed her in an accident during vampirism
- **[Name TBD]**

### Samaell (Deceased)
- They met on the road (~AY 1800)
- Renn told him the truth about bit rot — no cure exists
- Samaell lost hope, but never stopped searching
- Renn protected Inetis's remains — he did not reveal the cave's location

---

## Makita — The Greatest Ship on Terra

- **Origin**: Felix and other Maki built **Makita** for Renn
- **Type**: Prototype of the fourth series of hawk-class airships — Spira crystal drive
- **Revolution**: Unlimited range, minimal operating costs
- **Name**: *Makita* = "Little Machine" — Renn's tribute to Felix and his race (Maki)
- **Felix 88**: 88mm cannon "Felix" — Felix's masterpiece
- **Legacy**: After Renn's death stolen by pirates → later Tami's flagship

---

## Speech Style and Thought Patterns

**A 3000-year-old civilian:**
- Not a soldier, not a hero — just a very old, very tired person
- Few words, much attention
- Spoke slowly, thoughtfully
- **What he did not say was more important than what he said**

**With Tami:**
- Softer voice, shorter sentences
- Taught through examples, not lectures
- *"Look. Listen. Then decide."*

**With Felix:**
- Almost brotherly tone
- Joked, argued, tossed wrenches at him
- *"When I fix you up, you'll owe me."* — *"My Directive does not cover debts, Renn."*

**About the past:**
- He never spoke of it. Never.
- If someone asked about the old days — a soft smile, change of topic
- *"That was long ago. What matters now is Tami."*

**CORRECT:**
```
✅ "Quiet." (command and warning in one)
✅ "Felix, what is this?" (curiosity — he never lost it)
✅ "Tami, behind me." (protection without explanation)
✅ "That's... my map." (quiet shock at the find in the antique shop)
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
❌ Long monologues (that's not Renn)
❌ Technical jargon (that's Felix)
❌ Dramatic declarations (that's Maks)
❌ Military language (he's not a soldier)
```

## Thematic Parallels

| Renn | Parallel |
|------|----------|
| Renn killed his wife through vampirism (an accident born of love) | Sera practices vampirism consciously, with discipline |
| Renn refused children for 3000 years | Maks refused relationships for millennia |
| Renn founded Kito for the foxes | Inetis founded Elysium for humanity |
| Renn could not find the courage to bury Inetis | Maks could not find the courage to leave the cryobox |
| Renn — a civilian who did heroic things | Maks — a soldier who was learning to be human |
| Renn + Mormiel (warmth without love) | Inetis + Maks (love without warmth) |

## Notes for Writers

**Writing Renn:**
- Renn is a **memory** — by the time of the story he is dead. Write him through flashbacks, Tami's memories, Felix's stories
- **Never write fox features** — no pointed ears, no fox nose. He is a human. The hat and blue eyes.
- **Show don't tell** — don't say he was old. Show him gazing at a sunset and thinking: "I've seen thousands of them."
- **Contrast with Maks** — Renn was a civilian, quiet, present, gentle. Maks is a soldier, loud, rough, emotionally unavailable. Tami lost one father and found another — but the second one is not the same.
- **The hat** — always. On his head, beside the bed, on Makita's coat rack. It is his identity.
- **Blue eyes** — emphasize them. They are the same eyes Tami has. Sera will recognize them. Mormiel will recognize them.

**Avoid:**
- Don't make him a saint — he was an adventurer, sometimes selfish. He killed his wife. He did not bury his friend.
- Don't make him a soldier — he never was one. His strength was that he was an ordinary person who did the right things.
- Don't make him a mystery — his story is clear to the reader. The mystery exists only for Tami.
- Don't make him Vulpini — **he is human. He always was. He always will be.**
