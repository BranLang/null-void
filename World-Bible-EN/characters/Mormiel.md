### Origin — The Only Varietas from ARK-13

Mormiel is the **only Varietas** who survived the 700-year journey aboard ARK-13 "Prometheus." On Earth, she was one of the modified humans (Homo Sapiens Varietas) — biologically distinct, with hereditary nanobots (**Spira**) in her blood, but also carrying ancient Earth-era nanotech from the age of the Players.

- **Dual technology**: Unlike the other three Archangels (Samaell, Grond, Ishtar), who possessed only Earth-era military/civilian nanotech, Mormiel has **both systems** — ancient Earth nanotech (v1.0/military) and Spira (v2.0/Gift of the Mother). This combination makes her **extraordinarily powerful**.
- **Survival on ARK-13**: While the other three Archangels systematically consumed the sleeping colonists, Mormiel survived thanks to her dual biology. Her Spira partially shielded her from degradation — she did not need as many "patches" as the others.
- **Divine power**: The combination of two generations of nanotechnology gives her abilities that surpass any other Archangel. She is the **strongest** of all four — but she hides her power.

### Break with the Archangels — Betrayal and a New Life

After arriving on Achilles (~AY 700) and rescuing Elania, Mormiel **separated from the other Archangels**. While Samaell, Grond, and Ishtar divided power and seized control of different parts of the planet, Mormiel chose a different path.

- **Departure to the Varietas**: She left the Ex Inferis and went to live among the Varietas on the mainland. It was a natural choice — she was Varietas herself, biologically closer to them than to the Archangels.
- **Never revealed her past**: She never told anyone about ARK-13, about the Original Sin (consuming the colonists), about her collaboration with the other Archangels. Her sin is buried in silence.
- **Rise within the church**: Thanks to her incredible power (dual technology), she gradually rose to lead the Cult of the Mother. To the Varietas, she was a revelation — a being with Spira unlike anything they had ever seen. The first Blessed Mother that Nevriss ever knew was her — in her original form.
- **The Rite of Succession (The Succession)**: Every ~100 years, when her current appearance begins to raise suspicion (longevity), Mormiel stages a holy **Rite of Succession**:
  1. **Selection of the Maiden**: The departing Blessed Mother personally selects a young maiden from the people — always the purest, most devout, most beautiful. For the family, it is the greatest honor of their lives. The chosen girl is celebrated by the entire city.
  2. **Consecration behind closed doors**: The old Mother and the young candidate enter the Sanctum of Transformation together — a sealed chamber in the heart of the Main Temple. No one else may enter. The doors close for three days and three nights.
  3. **Consumption**: Behind the sealed doors, Mormiel **breaks the candidate down with nanotechnology** — her dual nanotech (Earth v1.0 + Spira v2.0) literally absorbs the young woman's body at the molecular level. Nothing remains of the candidate. Mormiel consumes her biological mass, nanobots, DNA — and **assumes her physical appearance**. It follows the same principle as the other Archangels' Harvest, but more sophisticated: not merely draining nanobots, but complete biological assimilation.
  4. **The "New Mother" emerges**: After three days, the doors open. A young woman steps out — the candidate's face, but with Mormiel's soul and power. The first thing the "new Blessed Mother" says to the assembled clergy: *"The Old Mother has been transformed into light. Inetis has called her to her side. I am her continuation and carry her blessing."*
  5. **The clergy accepts**: For the priestesses, it is the holiest moment — confirmation that the Mother chooses her daughters and that death does not exist, only transformation. They weep with joy. No one doubts. No one asks what happened behind the closed doors.
- **Historical continuity**: Over ~2,300 years of activity in the Cult of the Mother, Mormiel has cycled through **~23 identities**. Twenty-three young women, twenty-three families who spent their whole lives boasting that their daughter became the Blessed Mother. Twenty-three bodies dissolved to atoms behind closed doors.
- **The perfect crime**: No one has reason to suspect. The system has functioned for thousands of years. It is tradition, sacrament, the holiest ritual of the Church. Each "new" Mother rules for ~100 years, which is acceptable given the extreme longevity of Pursang priestesses (the strongest Spirists live to 250+ years). No one asks why each Mother rules for exactly that long.
- **Mormiel's deflection**: When someone occasionally dares to hint at a question about why the Mother always chooses such a young candidate, Mormiel dismisses them with a calm smile and the words: *"One day you will learn... when the Sleeper awakens."* This response is brilliant — it references the prophecy about the end of the world, implying that the truth about the ritual is part of a divine plan. No one asks further, because the Sleeper = the Devil = the end of the world. Who would want to hasten that?

### Public Identity — The Blessed Mother

In Nevriss City, Mormiel is known as the **Blessed Mother** — the high priestess and head of the Council of High Priestesses, leader of the entire Cult of the All-Knowing Mother. She is not perceived as a single immortal being — she is perceived as a **line of holy women**, each inheriting the blessing from the one before.

- **In plain sight**: She does not hide in the shadows like Samaell, nor behind illusions like Ishtar. She sits on the throne in the Main Temple, blesses children, leads rituals, delivers sermons. All of Nevriss reveres her. To the priestesses, each Blessed Mother is a different woman — yet the same in wisdom and power. This only strengthens the faith.
- **A perfect mask**: She presents herself as a gracious, wise, maternal figure. The people love her. No one questions her holiness. Each "new" Mother rules for ~100 years, which is long, but acceptable given the extreme longevity of Pursang priestesses. The Mother's age never arouses suspicion — it is simply a blessing of Spira.
- **Institutional memory**: The clergy keeps chronicles of the Blessed Mothers' lineage. They record their names, origins, years of rule. For Church historians, it is proof of stability and divine continuity. For Mormiel, they are monuments to victims no one will ever find.
- **Information control**: As the head of the church, she controls what is taught, what is preached, and what is forbidden. Any hints about the true origin of the technology, about the Archangels, or about the Sleeper — all of it passes through her hands. And above all — **no one has ever challenged the Rite of Succession**. It is the holiest ceremony of the Church, taboo to question, and Mormiel has ensured it stays that way.

### Nocturnal Identity — The Vampire of Nevriss City

By dawn, the Blessed Mother. By dark — a **predator**.

- **Jack the Ripper of Nevriss**: At night, she leaves the temple and hunts the city streets. Her victims are always from the lowest classes — beggars, drunks, prostitutes, Ghorki without Spira. People no one asks about.
- **The Harvest**: Like the other Archangels, Mormiel needs fresh nanobots to sustain her deteriorating system. But thanks to her dual technology, she needs to feed **less frequently** than the others — allowing her to be more discreet.
- **Urban legend**: Whispers circulate through Nevriss City about the **"Night Shadow"** — a being that appears in dark alleyways and leaves behind desiccated bodies. The guards blame Wraiths or disease. No one suspects the Blessed Mother.
- **Method**: Unlike Samaell's brutal hunting, Mormiel is surgically precise. Her victims die quietly, without a struggle, often in ecstasy — her combination of Spira and ancient nanotech lets her paralyze the victim and drain their nanobots painlessly.
- **Pleasure**: Mormiel **relishes** the vampirism. It is not mere maintenance — it is power, dominance, control. She enjoys seeing the fear and suffering in her victims' eyes. For her, it is confirmation that she is a goddess and they are merely sustenance.
- **Contrast with Sera**: Both carry Gen 1+2 nanobots, both practice vampirism. But Sera does it with revulsion and guilt. Mormiel with ecstasy and sadistic pleasure. Sera has clarity in her head. Mormiel lives in lies — even to herself.

### Motivation

- **Survival**: Like all Archangels, Mormiel fights against the entropy of her own body. Her 2,700-year-old technology is degrading — Glitch slowly devours her from within, even if more slowly than the others.
- **Power through faith**: Unlike Grond (military force) or Ishtar (illusions), Mormiel chose **religion** as her instrument. She controls the souls of the entire southern continent. That is more powerful than any army.
- **Fear of exposure**: Her greatest fear is that someone will uncover the truth — not just the nighttime hunting, but above all the **Rite**. That the Blessed Mother, the embodiment of love and mercy, is a predator who consumes the purest daughter of her own people every hundred years and wears her face. Twenty-three families who spent their whole lives thanking the Mother for that honor — never knowing their daughter was dissolved to atoms.

### Psychology — A Shattered Mind

- **Living in lies**: Mormiel lies to everyone — the clergy, the Varietas, the other Archangels. But worst of all, she lies to herself.
- **Not right in the head**: 2,950 years of pretending have warped her psyche. Sometimes she forgets which face is real.
- **Ambition**: Unlike Sera (no ambitions), Mormiel craves power. Not just survival — *dominion*.
- **Contrast with Sera**: Sera = pure human, clear head, pragmatic. Mormiel = Varietas, shattered psyche, living in self-delusion.

### Relationship with the Other Archangels

- **Samaell**: She despised him — she considered him a beast that had lost its mind. His death (AY 3001) unsettled her, but she did not mourn.
- **Grond** (the real one, dead): She respected him as a soldier. She knows about the dynasty of impostors — they are a useful puppet in the north for her.
- **Ishtar**: The most complicated relationship. Both are manipulators, both hide behind facades. A quiet rivalry over influence in the south.
- **Elania**: Mormiel knows her true identity (daughter of Inetis). She fears her — Elania is the only being who could truly threaten her.

### Renn (Deceased — Former Partner)

- **Shared Past**: Both from Earth, both immortal, both lonely. They met at the Nevriss court during the empire's golden age (~AY 1000-1500).
- **Physical Relationship**: Not love — warmth between two people who knew too much about the world. Intimacy born of necessity, not passion. Sometimes closer, sometimes distant — it shifted across the centuries.
- **Fellow Hunters**: Mormiel taught Renn vampirism (his Gen 1 was degrading). They roamed the streets together at night — two hunters in one city. They spawned urban legends about nocturnal shadows.
- **Departure**: Renn left one day — no drama, no explanation. Mormiel expected it. He had restless feet; she had ambitions. They weren't good together — just less bad.
- **Renn's Blue Eyes**: Mormiel remembers them. Unforgettable. Human.
- **When Mormiel Sees Tami** (AY 3013): She recognizes those eyes. Renn's blue eyes in a fox's face. Renn's daughter + Echo of Inetis = **the most valuable vessel for the Rite of Succession**. Personal history + power + hybrid heritage = an irresistible combination. Mormiel can't articulate it — but she feels that this girl is *something more*.
- **Impact on Tami — Layers of the Ritual**: When Tami undergoes the Ritual, the impact will be two-layered:
  1. **Echo of Inetis** — Tami senses Inetis's essence (primary technical reason for the selection)
  2. **Father (Renn)** — through Inetis's memories, Tami **sees her father**. Renn was in Inetis's Core Team for 150+ years — Inetis remembers him. This impact will be **greater than the Echo** — Tami lost her father, and now she sees him through the eyes of someone who knew him 2000 years ago.
  - *Note: Renn knew about Maks's origin, but it has no direct impact on Tami. The Elania/Maks relationship is a separate emotional line — it impacts Maks, not Tami.*

### The Antenna — A Memory of Inetis

Mormiel remembers Inetis. She saw her on the battlefield — where Shoraven now stands — walking away, leaning on a **black staff**. She always carried it with her. Mormiel never paid much attention to it — she had her own plans, her own ambitions. But she knew what it was.

> **The Antenna.** An artifact capable of controlling swarms of spirits — whether Spirit (v2.0) or ancient nanobots (v1.0). Inetis used it to direct massive construction projects. Mormiel suspected it could control something else entirely.

**AY 3013 — Report from the black market:**
- Mormiel's spies report: *"An item has appeared on the market — a staff — that matches no known technology. Supposedly from somewhere in the east."*
- Mormiel freezes. **She recognizes it.** Black. Smooth. Utterly unremarkable — to those who do not know.
- She immediately issues orders: Find the seller. Acquire the artifact. *Cover the tracks.*
- The crew of the Makita is burned at the stake in the square as heretics. Mormiel acquires the Antenna.
- It is her most prized artifact. And no one may know she has it.

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**2950+ years (the oldest antagonist):**
- Every word is **perfectly calculated**
- She never loses control of her voice
- Maternal, gracious, kind — and beneath it, **ice**

**Public face (Blessed Mother):**
- Gentle, calm voice
- Speaks in blessings and wisdoms
- *"My child, the Mother forgives all."*

**Private face (Archangel):**
- Cold, surgical precision
- Pragmatic like Maks, but without emotion
- *"Twenty-three bodies. Twenty-three families. No one asks."*

**CORRECT:**
```
"May the Mother's blessing go with you." (in public)
"One day you will learn... when the Sleeper awakens." (double-edged)
A maternal tone hiding death beneath
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Anger, frustration, loss of control
Direct threats (she manipulates, never threatens)
Revealing the truth (always lies and half-truths)
```

**Contrast:**
- Sera: a veteran who still feels
- Mormiel: a predator who feels nothing anymore


### Role in the Story

- **Book 1 (Earth)**: The Blessed Mother is present in the background — her priests guard the Antenna in Shoraven, her word shapes the politics of Nevriss. Maks and Tami hear about her, but they do not meet her directly.
- **Revelation**: Her true identity as the 4th Archangel will be revealed later in the story — when Maks realizes the enemy does not sit only in the north and east, but also in the heart of the allied city.
