# Grond (Archangel of War / "The Immortal Ruler")

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **Alive** — one of the original four Ex Inferis |
| **Age** | ~3,300 years (chronologically), appears ~50 |
| **Domain** | The North (Graw), industrial hellscape |
| **Appearance** | Power Armor = walking tank |
| **Boss** | Book 2 |
| **Philosophy** | "The strong survive" |

### Origin
- One of the four original Ex Inferis from Earth
- Arrived on ARK-13 "Prometheus"
- **Appearance**: Muscular, brutal, like The Rock in The Scorpion King / Conan
- **Power Armor**: Energy armor he never takes off — it became a symbol of divine power

### Survival
- **Requires human sacrifices** — like all Ex Inferis, Grond must consume other humans to replace his degrading nanobots
- **Cannibalism as ritual**: The people of Graw believe that "offering one's body to Grond" is the highest honor. They don't know that their god literally devours them.
- **Public face**: No one has seen his face beneath the helmet in 3,000 years — the Power Armor is his "skin"
- **Private truth**: Beneath the armor is a ruined body held together only by nanobots and a constant supply of fresh biological material

### Rule Over Graw (AY 700 - 3013)
- First ~500 years: a just and reasonable ruler, the Varietas loved him
- Gradually: paranoia, cruelty, and growing dependence on human sacrifices
- **Present day**: A tyrant waging war against the South (Nevriss) — 5-year winter, food shortages, the South refuses to trade with "heretics"
- Army of primitive tanks and exoskeletons

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**3,300+ years (war god):**
- Speaks **slowly, loudly, with weight**
- Every word is a command
- No one interrupts him. No one.

**Paranoid tyrant:**
- Sees betrayal everywhere
- Trusts no one — not even himself
- *"Everyone who has power wants it for themselves."*

**Former just ruler:**
- Occasional flashes of the old Grond — wisdom, fairness
- But paranoia always steamrolls over them
- *"I once believed in justice. Now I only believe in strength."*

**CORRECT:**
```
"Death is honor. Life is service."
Short, punchy statements
Military metaphors, commands
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Long explanations (that's Kito)
Gentleness, diplomacy (that's Mormiel)
Doubts spoken aloud
```

**Contrast:**
- Max: a soldier who thinks
- Grond: a soldier who only fights
