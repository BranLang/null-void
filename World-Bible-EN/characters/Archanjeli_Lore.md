# Archangels (Executors)

Four immortal rulers, **the original ex inferis from Earth**.
- **Betrayal of the Oath**: Originally sent as the vanguard of the "Achilles Initiative" to build a stronghold for a counterattack to liberate Earth. Instead, they broke their military oath, succumbing to fear and decadence.
- **Original Sin (Origin)**: They survived the 700-year journey drifting through the void only through the cold decision to systematically **consume the sleeping colonists** aboard ARK-13.
- **Present Day (The Harvest)**: They are parasites on the brink of extinction. Their 2,700-year-old technology is failing (Glitch), and the only way to keep it running is through "patches" of active nanobots ("Gift of the Mother") drained from the Varietas. This process ("the Harvest") leaves the victims as nothing but "desiccated husks."
- **Role in the Story**: They are not merely powerful tyrants — they are tragic, monstrous biological relics fighting for every second of existence.

### The Four Archangels
1. **Samaell** (Archangel of Shadows) — Crazed predator in the ruins. Killed by Maks in AY 3001. Ex Inferis (human).
2. **Grond** (Archangel of War) — Just ruler of the North. Died of Glitch Rot ~AY 1200. Replaced by a dynasty of impostors in Power Armor. Ex Inferis (human).
3. **Ishtar** (Archangel of Pleasure) — Manipulator of the South, hidden behind illusions of beauty. Appears in the story as **Zaya**. Ex Inferis (human).
4. **Mormiel** (The Blessed Mother) — **The only Varietas** from ARK-13. Hidden in plain sight as the head of the Cult of the All-Knowing Mother in Nevriss City. She possesses **dual technology** (ancient Earth nanotech + Spira), making her the **most powerful** of the Archangels. Every ~100 years she performs the **Rite of Succession** — selects a young maiden from the populace, behind closed doors consumes her with nanotechnology and assumes her likeness. Over ~2,300 years she has cycled through ~23 identities. At night she hunts the streets like a techno-vampire.
