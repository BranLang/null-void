# Samaell (Archangel of Shadows / The Exile)

| **Age** | **~2,950+ chronological years** (born ~2050 on Earth; biologically ~60 thanks to cryostasis and nanotech) |
| **Identity** | **OG *ex inferis*** (Veteran of the Achilles VR hell) |
| **Origin** | Earth -> Alpha Centauri -> Achilles (ARK-13) |
| **Domain** | Laboratory ruins, Northern Wasteland |
| **Role** | Crazed antagonist of Book 1 / Techno-Predator |

### Characteristics
Samaell hunts Varietas using **needle injectors** on his fingers, draining nanobots directly from their bodies (the Harvest) while they are alive and full of adrenaline.
- **Predatory instinct**: To him, the Archangels are not saviors but predators. He hunts Kael and lets him suffer to "feed" his systems.
- **Contact with Maks**: He intercepts the signal **EX-INF-003** (Maksimilian). Shock at learning that the "old Earth dog" survived the fall of Earth, which the Archangels abandoned because of an alien threat. An old rivalry and a hunger for answers awakens in Samaell: How could the Major survive where everyone else burned?
- **Rivalry**: He remembers Maks as a scarred bastard from the red plains of Mars.
- **Glitches**: Unlike Maks, Samaell's nanodrones are in a state of entropy. His code is decaying, causing hallucinations ("AI Voices") and physical pain.
- **Blind Hunt**: Samaell senses Maks's **"Fog"** (nanotechnological aura). He is fascinated by it — after 3,000 years, he has found someone his equal.
- **Motivation**: He believes that if he consumes Maksimilian's blood (pure, non-glitching military Dust), it will repair his decaying code, grant him immortality, and allow him to definitively defeat Elania.

> *"I'd recognize you even after millennia, maXpowa. You reek of the Coordinator's blood and Martian smoke. Your blood is the key to my reboot. Give me your hand... and let me drink."*

### Duel with Samaell (AY 3001)

**Context**: Samaell hunts Maks and little Tami one year after Maks's awakening. Maks is still blind but has his nanodrones.

**Maks's weapons**:
- **FPV nanodrones**: The size of a grain of sand, technology from the Achilles simulation
- **Tactics**: Scout the enemy with a drone, infiltrate the airways, detonate
- **Long-range duel**: The fight took place over enormous distances — Samaell had no idea Maks could see him through the drones

**Progression**:
- Samaell underestimated his "blind" opponent
- Maks used a technique he invented in the Achilles simulation — the foundation of modern warfare
- Nanodrones penetrated Samaell's airways

**Outcome**:
- **Samaell's death**: The first Archangel killed since the arrival of ARK-13
- **Technovampirism**: Maks seized Samaell's nanobots (Highlander style)
- **Power boost**: Maks's abilities increased significantly
- **Secret**: No one except Tami knows that Samaell is dead

**Consequences**:
- Maks gained a portion of Samaell's power and memories
- Tami was a witness — it builds their bond
- The other Archangels do not know that Samaell is dead
