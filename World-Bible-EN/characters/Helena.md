## Who Was Helena?

Helena was one of the **Ex Inferis** — survivors of the Glitch Event (~EY 2065) who received the "First Gift" (nanobots) from Inetis. She was Inetis's **best friend** — one of the few beings to whom Inetis ever formed a genuine bond. She was not a soldier. She was her heart.

### Personality
- **Artist**: While Inetis was the architect and system builder, Helena was the creator of beauty. She was a painter, a poet, the soul of the group.
- **Spirited**: She was full of emotion. She raged, she laughed, she wept. For Inetis, who struggled to express feelings, Helena was a translator of humanity.
- **Gentle and Caring**: She did not fight with weapons, but with empathy. She looked after the others when they were wounded in body or in spirit.

### Relationship with Inetis
- **Best friends**: Within the Ex Inferis community, they were inseparable. Helena was the one who "grounded" Inetis — reminding her that life is not only about survival, but about living.
- **Guardian**: Helena placed herself between Inetis and the world not with physical strength, but with emotional support. She protected her humanity.
- **Conflict**: When Maksimilian came to evacuate Inetis, Helena said she understood and that it was the right thing to do. But it broke her heart. It was a personal tragedy.

## Final Meeting — A Lost Dream

The ship **NULL VOID** was originally meant for **Helena and Inetis**. Two best friends, together on a new planet, far from war, far from chaos. That was their plan. Their escape.

Then the order came.

**The Coordinator (John Reef)** — Inetis's father — gave Maksimilian a direct order: *"Evacuate my daughter. Take care of her. This is your new mission."*

Maks was a soldier. He could not refuse an order. And the Coordinator knew exactly who to send — the only man Inetis trusted.

> *"Ela, I'm sorry."*
>
> *"I understand. He's a soldier. He has orders."*
>
> *"I could refuse—"*
>
> *"No. You can't. And you won't. You're an architect, not a fighter. He can protect you. I can't."*
>
> *"Ela..."*
>
> *"Go. Build something beautiful there. For both of us."*
>
> — Final conversation between Helena and Inetis

Helena did not smile. She did not strike a heroic pose. She stood there and watched her best friend leave with a man she barely knew.

## Legacy

- **The Cave of Ela**: Inetis named her first refuge on Achilles after Helena — **Ela** (short for Helena).
- **Elania**: Inetis's daughter bears a name derived from Helena — **Elania**. A tribute to the friend who sacrificed everything.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mythological parallel:**
> The planet is called **Achilles**. In Greek mythology, Achilles was a warrior of the Trojan War — a war sparked by **Helen of Troy**.
>
> Helena (Ex Inferis) stayed on Earth and perished. Her name lives on the planet Achilles — in the cave **Ela** and in the daughter **Elania**.
>
> *Helena sparked a war on old Earth. Her legacy lives on in the new world.*
