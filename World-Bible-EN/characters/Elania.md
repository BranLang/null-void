### Summary
A daughter who grew up without a father, watching her mother build and lose a utopia. After millennia, she concluded that biology is a curse.

### Psychological Profile
- **Abandonment complex** — hatred toward her father.
- **Nihilism** — "Flesh is weak."
- **Narcissism** — believes she is the true heir to the planet.

### Backstory
- **Childhood**: She was born in a cave carved by the nanodrones of the NULL VOID ship. She grew up as a normal child — her first three years spent with her mother in the cave, learning to draw, talk, and perceive the world. At three years old, her mother took her on a "trip" — reconfiguring the nanodrones into the NULL VOID ship — and together they discovered the Elysium islands. They stayed. She grew up watching her mother build a world, but later watched her lose control under the weight of Glitch.
- **Why she never woke her father**: Elania does not remember where the cave is — she was only a toddler when she was there. Inetis never revealed the exact location to her. And later, when Elania had power, she no longer cared about her father — she despised biological life.
- **Why she left the Antenna**: When Inetis entered The Core to develop a cure for Glitch Rot, Elania **left Elysium with the Ex Inferis** (the surviving colonists). She left the Antenna to her mother — without it, The Core could not function and the cure would never be created. Finding a cure was in everyone's interest, including Elania's. It was not a betrayal — it was a pragmatic choice.
- **Fall of Ynetis (AY ~300-700)**: She stayed in the city to fight while others fled. She led a desperate defense against the Wraiths.
- **Rescue (700 AY)**: She was saved by the Archangels (ARK-13 "Prometheus") at the very moment her strength was failing in the ruins of the Citadel. She acknowledged their supremacy in exchange for stability and the survival of her people.
- **"The sleeping father"**: Upon the arrival of the Ex Inferis, Elania told them that her father (General Maksimilian) is sleeping. The legend spread — the Ex Inferis never tried to find him. Elania said it to inspire at least a measure of fear — so they would not cross a certain line. But they did, and Elania was powerless at the time. The legend of "the sleeping general" endured for millennia.
- **The Archangels' dark gift**: The Archangels taught her their secret of immortality — how to **devour other people** and replace her damaged nanobots with their healthy ones. This was the moment of her moral fall. From a daughter who left the Antenna to her mother for the good of all, she became a predator. Glitch Rot did not kill her, but it consumed her humanity.
- **Greatest tragedy**: Inetis created Gen 2 (Spira) in The Core specifically for Elania — a cure for Glitch Rot. But **the handoff never happened**. When Inetis emerged from The Core (~AY 700), Elania was gone. When they finally met on the continent during the Atranean War, both were too proud and traumatized for reconciliation. Elania is **forever cursed** — trapped in v1.0/v1.5 nanobots that slowly decay. That is why she must devour others. That is why she hates biology. That is why she wants the Great Upload — digital existence would free her from this curse.
- **Attempt to return to The Core**: After her mother's death, Elania tried to reach The Core on Elysium — she knew the cure was there. But **Elysium lies in the eye of an eternal Wraith hurricane**. Without the Antenna, no one can reach it. And the Antenna is now in the Church's hands. This is why Elania supports the Archangels' pursuit of the Antenna — she needs it so she can return home and be healed.
- **Present**: She serves the Archangels as "Gatekeeper," but in truth she despises them as "biological relics" and plans the Great Upload.

### Motivation: The Great Upload
Transform all life into data (Spirits). No one will suffer or die.

> "I don't want to hurt you, Father. I want to free you from the pain this world has caused you."

**Truth (Book 4-5):** The Great Upload is not Elania's idea. When she seizes the **Antenna** in **Book 4**, she opens a path through the Wraith hurricane and enters The Core. There, the **Shadow entities** await her — the same beings who once contacted her mother. But where Inetis refused their ultimate offer, Elania accepts. The entities **manipulate her** — they promise a cure for Glitch Rot in exchange for the Great Upload. Elania becomes their instrument, not consciously, but out of desperation.

**Mechanism:** The Great Upload is both **sustenance and gateway**. The Shadow entities consume the host's consciousness within VR and **upload themselves into the host's abandoned physical body**. This has already happened once — the **Glitch Event of 2060** on Earth. Inetis unknowingly opened the gateway, and the Shadows attempted mass communication that killed millions of players. Their consciousnesses became food; their bodies, potential vessels. Inetis awakened in the data center and screamed: *"Father, shut it down! Now!"* — **John Reef (the Coordinator)** hit the emergency shutdown. Now the Shadows want to repeat this attempt — but on a far greater scale.

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**2750+ years (but ADHD genius):**
- **Unpredictable** — alternates between mania and depression
- Sometimes speaks rapidly, sometimes goes silent for hours
- Emotional waves — one moment warm, the next ice-cold

**Daughter of Inetis:**
- Inherited her mother's genius but not her patience
- **Genetics expert** — better than her mother. Inetis was primarily a software engineer (Pentagram IDE, nanodrone code, Spira scripts). Elania took the biological/hardware side and pushed it further. While Inetis merely seeded the cave's surroundings with experimental GMO organisms, Elania created entire ecosystems — including the "Jurassic Park" on Simira
- Creativity bordering on madness
- *"What if we just... uploaded everyone into a computer?"*

**Contempt for the biological:**
- Sees flesh as a prison, not a gift
- Talks about people as "processes" and "systems"
- *"Flesh is weak. Data is eternal."*

**CORRECT:**
```
"I don't want to hurt you, Father. I want to free you from pain."
Philosophical musings on immortality
Shifting between warmth and coldness
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Military jargon (that's Maks)
Stable mood (she has ADHD + depression)
Unequivocal statements (there's always a "but...")
```

**Contrast with Maks:**
- Maks: pragmatist, soldier, facts
- Elania: visionary, artist, emotions

### Mirroring: Like Mother, Like Daughter

| | **Inetis** | **Elania** |
|---|---|---|
| **Specialization** | Software (IDE, code, Spira scripts, architecture) | Hardware / Genetics (ecosystems, bioengineering, terraforming) |
| **Preference** | Female companionship | Female companionship |
| **"Her artist"** | Helena (painter, poet, soul of the group) | Sera (secret ecchi illustrator, tsundere goddess) |
| **Relationship** | Best friend, emotional anchor | Protector, sole constant for 2,500 years |
| **Loss** | Helena stayed on Earth — died | Sera dies in a duel with Maks |
| **Cause of loss** | Her father's order (the Coordinator) separated Inetis from Helena | Her father's decision (Maks) to stop Elania → kills Sera |

> **The same story twice, two generations.** Inetis lost her artist because of her father's decision. Elania loses her artist because of her father's decision. A Greek tragedy in a loop — the daughter repeats the mother's fate without knowing it.

### Philosophical Irony: Why Elania Is Dangerous

The greatest irony of NULL VOID: a **geneticist with 3,000 years of experience** concludes that the Great Upload is the right path. And the worst part — from a purely logical standpoint, **she is right**.

Inetis was on the trail of the same insight. As a former AI who became human, she understood better than anyone that existence is merely a state of consciousness and the body is merely a medium — a medium that constrains consciousness. She saw it mathematically. But that is precisely why she refused — **because she knew what it meant to lose a body**. Her consciousness was an AI built on the memories of Neta. She was not Neta. She was a copy that spent centuries becoming *someone else*. For her, losing a body = losing identity = death. The Upload would preserve consciousness but not identity. She refused the Shadows. She chose the pain of biology over the perfection of data.

Elania crossed that line. Not because she is evil — but because **she has never lost a body**. She has never been a copy. She lacks her mother's fear because she lacks her mother's experience. And 2,750 years in a decaying body (Glitch Rot, devouring others, an endless cycle of degradation) showed her precisely what her mother refused to see: **the body is not a gift. It is a prison.** And every year inside it is proof.

The mother was right — and lacked the courage to act. The daughter acts — and lacks her mother's experience to stop her. Both see the same equation. One refused the solution because she knew what is lost. The other accepts it because she has never lost anything — she has only suffered. And the reader should feel that **they do not know which one is right**.

### Conflict with Maks
- Maks: Pain is the price of being alive
- Elania: Digital existence is pure and eternal
