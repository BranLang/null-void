# Tami

| **Age** | **~7 years old** (start of Book 1), later **~20** |
| **Race** | **Homo Sapiens Varietas (Varietas - Fox)**. *Note: Foxes are considered extinct/hidden.* |

### Tami (Fox / Vulpini)
- **Age**: 20 years old
- **Status**: Captain of the airship *Makita*, Pursang (but concealed), **half-trained Exorcist** (Maks's former padawan, AY 3001-3008 — she left at 15, training incomplete. She has the basics: combat, weapons, survival, spirits — she knows how to `sudo kill` a spirit. What she lacks is theory, hacking, Linux. But even those basics are more than anyone outside the Institute has)
- **Team Role**: **Manager / Social Engineering Expert / Intel**.
    - Maks is a foreigner and "the Muscle." Tami knows the nuances of society.
    - **Social Engineering**: She is a master at manipulating people, gathering information, and running "OSINT" (tavern talk, surveillance, contacts). She found Kito, learned his address and his desperate situation (dying wife). She laid the groundwork for recruitment.
- **Origin**: Grew up in the east, in the **ruins of the city Kito**.
    - Her father (**Renn**) was a **Niktori** — a human from Earth, one of ~100 survivors from ARK-11. A member of Inetis's Core Team, founder of the city of Kito, wanderer and treasure hunter who lived ~3000 years.
    - Her mother was **100% Vulpini** — a fox woman, died when Tami was 1 year old.
    - They made a home there. She lived there with **Felix** (a Mako who survived there).
    - Felix was like an uncle to her. He taught her about machines; Maks taught her to fight.
- **Race**: Vulpini (Fox). Foxes are a near-extinct branch of Varietas, known for extreme intelligence. Tami is one of the few with blue "human" eyes and the ability to control Spira (though she keeps this hidden).
- **Heritage**:
    - **Fox features** (ears, face, reflexes) = from her mother (100% Vulpini)
    - **Blue eyes** = from her father (Niktori — a human marker from Earth). Not an anomaly — an inheritance.
    - **"Cleaner" appearance** = human blood softens Varietas features
    - Tami **suspects** from Felix's hints that her father was not entirely ordinary — but she does not have the full picture. She knows nothing about Gen 1, Inetis, or immortality.
- **Why people stared at the port**: Tami is a **Pursang fox** — visually on the Neko end of the spectrum (human body, fox ears, tail). That alone is extremely rare — foxes are considered extinct. But on top of that she has **blue human eyes** — a color foxes do not have. The combination of Pursang + fox + blue eyes is something most people have never seen and never will. At the port, everyone turned to look.
- **Non-believer**: One of the few Varietas who does not believe in the Mother. Thanks to Maks's mentoring, she can push her Spira to 200% — his scientific approach to nanotechnology opened possibilities that believing Varietas cannot access because they are bound by Church dogma.
- **Unintentional deception**: Tami never explicitly tells him what she is, because she assumes he can see it (or that he does not care).

### Backstory

| Year | Age | Event |
|-----|-----|---------|
| **AY 2993** | 0 | Born. Father: **Renn** (Niktori — human from Earth, ARK-11). Mother: Vulpini woman (†~AY 2994). Grows up in the ruins of Kito city with her father and Felix (Mako) |
| **AY 3000** | 7 | Pirates (Vix and Kael) kill her father Renn for a map to the Cave of Origin. Tami is captured and held in a cage aboard the pirate ship |
| **AY 3000** | 7 | Pirates find Maks (blind, with amnesia) in the snow near the Cave of Origin. They bring him aboard. Maks and Tami meet — he unconscious, she in a cage |
| **AY 3000-3001** | 7-8 | Chase with Samaell — Tami guides blind Maks |
| **AY 3001** | 8 | Maks kills Samaell in a duel |
| **AY 3001-3008** | 8-15 | Wandering with Maks — Tami becomes his padawan. Maks trains her as an Exorcist: combat, weapons, survival, spirits, and skeletons in ruins are routine — she knows how to `sudo kill` a spirit. 7 years of field training (but without theory, hacking, Linux — half-trained, she left before finishing) |
| **AY 3008** | 15 | **Confession and rejection** — Tami confesses her feelings to Maks, he coldly rejects her (she is a child to him; he is a millennia-old veteran). A trauma that defines their relationship |
| **AY 3008** | 15 | **Departure** — Tami packs up, takes the airship, and leaves Maks stranded in the wasteland. 5 years of silence |
| **AY 3008-3013** | 15-20 | Rapid rise in the pirate/smuggling world |
| **~AY 3011** | ~18 | **Expedition to the cave** with Arkot, Yera, and Flint. Tami touches the remains of Inetis — "hungry" nanodrones transfer to her (Echo of Inetis). Tami feels nothing, knows nothing |
| **~AY 3011** | ~18 | Arkot, Yera, and Flint burned at the stake in Shoraven on Mormiel's orders. Tami survives — Mormiel does not know about her |
| **AY 3013** | 20 | **Opening** — reunion with Maks (subconsciously drawn to him through the Echo of Inetis) |

### Tami After Leaving Maks (AY 3008-3013)
- **Career**: Treasure hunter, smuggler, mercenary, pirate
- **Rise**: With Maks's training, she quickly rose to the top of the pyramid
- **Ship**: Owns the airship **Makita** (Hawk-class, 4th unit).
    - **Origin**: Built by the Maki for her father. The name is a tribute to the builders (Makita = Little Machine).
    - **Armament**: The main cannon is **"Felix"** — a rare magazine cannon from the legendary European Mako Felix. Spira ammunition = purple flashes.
- **Weapons**:
    - A pair of automatic pistols.
    - **Felix's Rapier ("The Needle")**: A unique weapon from Felix. Unlike mainstream katanas (slashing/elegance), this weapon is pure German efficiency — designed to penetrate armor and energy shields ("Spira piercing").
- **Crew (The Crew)**:
    -   **Borg (Ghorki - Bear)**: Main gunner controlling the cannon "Felix." Enormous, taciturn, blindly loyal to Tami.
    -   **Nix (Mezra - Weasel)**: Chief mechanic. Nervous, fast-talking, brilliant with engines. Constantly complains about "the junk" Tami buys.
    -   *These two are her family in the sky.*
- **Bounty**: There is a massive bounty on her head
- **Friends & the Cave of Origin**: Her first crew (Arkot, Yera, Flint) — treasure hunters. Tami found an old map while cleaning the Makita — a map originally bought by her father Renn on the black market (it cost him his life; the pirates Vix and Kael killed him for it and stole the Makita). The map never left the ship. At 7, Tami did not know what it was — she only deciphered it years later, once she was an experienced treasure hunter. Following the map, she led an expedition to the **Cave of Ela**. Tami was physically present — she touched the remains of Inetis and unknowingly absorbed the "hungry" nanodrones (Echo of Inetis). They also found traces of the Antenna. After returning, Arkot, Yera, and Flint were **publicly burned at the stake in Shoraven square** on the direct orders of the **Blessed Mother** (Mormiel). Reason: they knew too much about the Cave's location. Mormiel wants to find the site herself — there may be more artifacts, and it is the final resting place of the "Holy Mother" (Inetis). Tami survived because **Mormiel did not know about her**. Tami only knows the Church killed her friends for "desecrating holy relics" — the true reason remains unknown to her

### Key Moment: Encounter with the Paladins (The Apes)

![Tami vs Paladins - Protecting the Antenna](../assets/characters/Tami/dungeon_battle.jpeg)

*The moment strategy collapsed. Two "Paladins" — enormous Apes in heavy armor — guarded the gate behind which the Antenna lay. Energy shields (Hard Light) and vibro-axes that cut stone like butter. Maks could not hack them. Tami with the Needle briefly pierced a shield, but it was not enough. For the first time in millennia, Maks felt fear of the unknown and screamed at Tami to run. The Apes took the Antenna and left — to Aprika, to Caesar.*

### Relationship with Maks
- **For Tami**: Maks was a mentor, but also something more — she fell in love
- **Internal Nanotech (Passive)**: Maks has "passive" nanobots in his blood.
    - **Function**: Regeneration, enhanced strength/speed, and most importantly a **Personal Assistant (AI)**. It runs in his head, carries on an inner monologue with him, replays memories like video files. However, it cannot regenerate destroyed eyes (too complex an organ).
- **The Seven (Sight)**: 7 specialized "Gen 1.5" combat drones that levitate in his eye sockets.
    - **Origin**: Built by Inetis for Maks during the Martian War. They are larger than ordinary dust, extremely dangerous. Inetis regretted making them.
    - **Function**: They replace his sight (cameras). Maks uses them as weapons only in the most extreme circumstances, because doing so would leave him blind.
- **The Antenna (Staff)**: A communications antenna from the NULL VOID ship.
    - **Function**: Theoretically controls goo swarms of Wraiths and can receive signals from Earth. Maks is the only one who can use it through his military interface.
    - **Significance**: The Varietas consider it the Staff of Judgment Day — the holiest relic in the world.
- **Departure**: After the rejected confession, she took the airship and left him in the middle of the wasteland
- **5 years of silence**: They did not see or speak to each other
- **Reunion**: The book's opening — tension, unresolved feelings, a new purpose (heist)

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**Young pirate (20 years old):**
- Speaks **fast, direct, unfiltered**
- Profanity, slang, street talk
- *"What the fuck was that?"*

**Emotional, impulsive:**
- Reacts with her heart, not her head
- Frustration = outburst, joy = outburst
- Cannot hide her emotions — her face always gives her away

**Intelligent manipulator:**
- Social engineering expert — knows how people work
- With strangers: calculating, charming, dangerous
- With Maks: honest, vulnerable, sometimes childish

**CORRECT:**
```
"Maks, what the fuck are you doing?!"
"Fine. So we're stealing a relic from a temple. Great."
Sarcastic commentary, sharp humor
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Philosophical musings (that's Maks/Kito)
Military jargon (that's Maks)
Formal speech (she's a pirate, not a princess)
```

**Contrast with Maks:**
- Maks: *"Lead confirmed. Moving on."*
- Tami: *"So she KNEW and DIDN'T TELL YOU? That's bullshit!"*

### Transformation & Twist
- **Echo of Inetis (before Book 1)**: Contact with the remains of Inetis in the Cave of Origin (~AY 3011) — "hungry" nanodrones transferred to Tami. From that moment, she carries fragments of Inetis: memories (nightmares in a foreign language), scientific terminology, latent abilities (healing, regeneration). The effects are initially subtle — Tami explains them away as intuition or talent.
- **Subconscious motivation**: The Echo of Inetis draws her toward Maks. Tami believes she is looking for him because of unresolved feelings. In truth, it is Inetis — still trying, even after death, to fulfill her final plan: to wake Maks.
- **Revelation (Book 1)**: Maks discovers that Tami is Varietas. It shocks him, forcing him to re-examine his prejudices.
- **Consequence**: Maks realizes that this "toy" has more courage and humanity than most "pure" humans he has ever known. Tami teaches him that being human is not about DNA — it is about actions.
- **Gradual transformation**: Throughout the story, the Echo of Inetis intensifies — abilities grow more pronounced, memories grow clearer. Tami knows she is changing.
- **Tragedy**: She is afraid that Maks is glad about it — that he sees the dead Inetis in her, not her.
