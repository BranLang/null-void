# Tami

| **Age** | **~7 years old** (start of Book 1), later **~20** |
| **Race** | **Homo Sapiens Varietas (Varietas - Fox)**. *Note: Foxes are considered extinct/hidden.* |

### Tami (Fox / Vulpini)
- **Age**: 20 years old
- **Status**: Captain of the airship *Makita*, Pursang (but concealed), **half-trained Exorcist** (Maks's former padawan, AY 3001-3008 — she left at 15, training incomplete. She has the basics: combat, weapons, survival, spirits — she knows how to `sudo kill` a spirit. What she lacks is theory, hacking, Linux. But even those basics are more than anyone outside the Institute has)
- **Team Role**: **Manager / Social Engineering Expert / Intel**.
    - Maks is a foreigner and "the Muscle." Tami knows the nuances of society.
    - **Social Engineering**: She is a master at manipulating people, gathering information, and running "OSINT" (tavern talk, surveillance, contacts). She found Kito, learned his address and his desperate situation (dying wife). She laid the groundwork for recruitment.
- **Origin**: Grew up in the east, in the **ruins of the city Kito**.
    - Her father (**Renn Ólafsson**) was an **Icelander** — a human from Earth, one of ~100 survivors from ARK-11. A member of Inetis's Core Team, founder of the city of Kito, wanderer and treasure hunter who lived ~3000 years.
    - Her mother was **100% Vulpini** — a fox woman, died when Tami was 1 year old.
    - They made a home there. She lived there with **Felix** (a Mako who survived there).
    - Felix was like an uncle to her. He taught her about machines; Maks taught her to fight.
- **Race**: Vulpini (Fox). Foxes are a near-extinct branch of Varietas, known for extreme intelligence. Tami is one of the few with blue "human" eyes and the ability to control Spira (though she keeps this hidden).
- **Heritage**:
    - **Fox features** (ears, face, reflexes) = from her mother (100% Vulpini)
    - **Blue eyes** = from her father (Renn Ólafsson — Icelander, a human marker from Earth). Not an anomaly — an inheritance.
    - **"Cleaner" appearance** = human blood softens Varietas features
    - Tami **suspects** from Felix's hints that her father was not entirely ordinary — but she does not have the full picture. She knows nothing about Gen 1, Inetis, or immortality.
- **Why people stared at the port**: Tami is a **Pursang fox** — visually on the Neko end of the spectrum (human body, fox ears, tail). That alone is extremely rare — foxes are considered extinct. But on top of that she has **blue human eyes** — a color foxes do not have. The combination of Pursang + fox + blue eyes is something most people have never seen and never will. At the port, everyone turned to look.
- **Non-believer**: One of the few Varietas who does not believe in the Mother. Thanks to Maks's mentoring, she can push her Spira to 200% — his scientific approach to nanotechnology opened possibilities that believing Varietas cannot access because they are bound by Church dogma.
- **Unintentional deception**: Tami never explicitly tells him what she is, because she assumes he can see it (or that he does not care).

### Backstory

| Year | Age | Event |
|-----|-----|---------|
| **AY 2993** | 0 | Born. **Tami Rennsdóttir.** Father: **Renn Ólafsson** (Icelander — human from Earth, ARK-11). Mother: Vulpini woman (†~AY 2994). Grows up in the ruins of Kito city with her father and Felix (Mako) |
| **AY 3000** | 7 | Pirates (Vix and Kael) kill her father Renn for a map to the Cave of Origin. Tami is captured and held in a cage aboard the pirate ship |
| **AY 3000** | 7 | Pirates find Maks (blind, with amnesia) in the snow near the Cave of Origin. They bring him aboard. Maks and Tami meet — he unconscious, she in a cage |
| **AY 3000-3001** | 7-8 | Chase with Samaell — Tami guides blind Maks |
| **AY 3001** | 8 | Maks kills Samaell in a duel |
| **AY 3001-3008** | 8-15 | Wandering with Maks — Tami becomes his padawan. Maks trains her as an Exorcist: combat, weapons, survival, spirits, and skeletons in ruins are routine — she knows how to `sudo kill` a spirit. 7 years of field training (but without theory, hacking, Linux — half-trained, she left before finishing) |
| **AY 3008** | 15 | **Confession and rejection** — Tami confesses her feelings to Maks, he coldly rejects her (she is a child to him; he is a millennia-old veteran). A trauma that defines their relationship |
| **AY 3008** | 15 | **Departure** — Tami packs up, takes the airship, and leaves Maks stranded in the wasteland. 5 years of silence |
| **AY 3008-3013** | 15-20 | Rapid rise in the pirate/smuggling world |
| **~AY 3011** | ~18 | **Expedition to the cave** with Arkot, Yera, and Flint. Tami touches the remains of Inetis — "hungry" nanodrones transfer to her (**Phase 1 — Seed**). A small dose of dormant nanodrones. Tami feels nothing, knows nothing. Effects are subtle: nightmares in a foreign language, enhanced Spira intuition, subconscious pull toward Maks |
| **~AY 3011** | ~18 | Arkot, Yera, and Flint burned at the stake in Shoraven on Mormiel's orders. Tami survives — Mormiel does not know about her |
| **AY 3013** | 20 | **Opening** — reunion with Maks (subconsciously drawn to him through the Echo of Inetis) |
| **AY 3013** | 20 | **Phase 2 — Activation:** Sera unlocks the Artifact in the tunnels beneath Shoraven and hands it to Tami (NOT Maks). Concentrated Essence of Inetis transfers to Tami — full awakening. Abilities, memories, connection to Inetis |
| **AY 3013** | 20 | **Phase 3 — Amplification:** After Maks's death, Tami returns to the Ela Cave and buries Maks beside Inetis. Proximity to Inetis's remains amplifies the Essence — full flashbacks, Inetis's memories like a film |
| **Book 5** | ~20+ | **Phase 4 — Core Contact:** Tami enters the Core (Ynetis) with Links and Elania. The Essence connects with AI i_net_is — an artificial intelligence locked inside the Core for 3000+ years. The AI reveals the truth about the Upload. Links translates. |

### Tami After Leaving Maks (AY 3008-3013)
- **Career**: Treasure hunter, smuggler, mercenary, pirate
- **Rise**: With Maks's training, she quickly rose to the top of the pyramid
- **Ship**: Owns the airship **Makita** (Hawk-class, 4th unit).
    - **Origin**: Built by the Maki for her father. The name is a tribute to the builders (Makita = Little Machine).
    - **Armament**: The main cannon is **"Felix"** — a rare magazine cannon from the legendary European Mako Felix. Spira ammunition = purple flashes.
- **Weapons**:
    - A pair of automatic pistols.
    - **Felix's Rapier ("The Needle")**: A unique weapon from Felix. Unlike mainstream katanas (slashing/elegance), this weapon is pure German efficiency — designed to penetrate armor and energy shields ("Spira piercing").
- **Crew (The Crew)**:
    -   **Borg (Ghorki - Bear)**: Main gunner controlling the cannon "Felix." Enormous, taciturn, blindly loyal to Tami.
    -   **Nix (Mezra - Weasel)**: Chief mechanic. Nervous, fast-talking, brilliant with engines. Constantly complains about "the junk" Tami buys.
    -   *These two are her family in the sky.*
- **Bounty**: There is a massive bounty on her head
- **Friends & the Cave of Origin**: Her first crew (Arkot, Yera, Flint) — treasure hunters. Tami found an old map while cleaning the Makita — a map originally bought by her father Renn on the black market (it cost him his life; the pirates Vix and Kael killed him for it and stole the Makita). The map never left the ship. At 7, Tami did not know what it was — she only deciphered it years later, once she was an experienced treasure hunter. Following the map, she led an expedition to the **Cave of Ela**. Tami was physically present — she touched the remains of Inetis and unknowingly absorbed the "hungry" nanodrones (Echo of Inetis). They also found traces of the Antenna. After returning, Arkot, Yera, and Flint were **publicly burned at the stake in Shoraven square** on the direct orders of the **Blessed Mother** (Mormiel). Reason: they knew too much about the Cave's location. Mormiel wants to find the site herself — there may be more artifacts, and it is the final resting place of the "Holy Mother" (Inetis). Tami survived because **Mormiel did not know about her**. Tami only knows the Church killed her friends for "desecrating holy relics" — the true reason remains unknown to her

### Key Moment: Encounter with the Paladins (The Apes)

![Tami vs Paladins - Protecting the Antenna](../assets/characters/Tami/dungeon_battle.jpeg)

*The moment strategy collapsed. Two "Paladins" — enormous Apes in heavy armor — guarded the gate behind which the Antenna lay. Energy shields (Hard Light) and vibro-axes that cut stone like butter. Maks could not hack them. Tami with the Needle briefly pierced a shield, but it was not enough. For the first time in millennia, Maks felt fear of the unknown and screamed at Tami to run. The Apes took the Antenna and left — to Simira, to Caesar.*

### Relationship with Maks
- **For Tami**: Maks was a mentor, but also something more — she fell in love
- **Internal Nanotech (Passive)**: Maks has "passive" nanobots in his blood.
    - **Function**: Regeneration, enhanced strength/speed, and most importantly a **Personal Assistant (AI)**. It runs in his head, carries on an inner monologue with him, replays memories like video files. However, it cannot regenerate destroyed eyes (too complex an organ).
- **The Seven (Sight)**: 7 specialized "Gen 1.5" combat drones that levitate in his eye sockets.
    - **Origin**: Built by Inetis for Maks during the Martian War. They are larger than ordinary dust, extremely dangerous. Inetis regretted making them.
    - **Function**: They replace his sight (cameras). Maks uses them as weapons only in the most extreme circumstances, because doing so would leave him blind.
- **The Antenna (Staff)**: A communications antenna from the NULL VOID ship.
    - **Function**: Theoretically controls goo swarms of Wraiths and can receive signals from Earth. Maks is the only one who can use it through his military interface.
    - **Significance**: The Varietas consider it the Staff of Judgment Day — the holiest relic in the world.
- **Departure**: After the rejected confession, she took the airship and left him in the middle of the wasteland
- **5 years of silence**: They did not see or speak to each other
- **Reunion**: The book's opening — tension, unresolved feelings, a new purpose (heist)
- **Maks's death**: Maks falls from the airship during battle. He dies in flames and wreckage — Tami weeps over him, but he can no longer hear her. In his final seconds he sees a café in Kyiv, the year 2075, Inetis sitting across from him. The soldier came home.

### Return to the Ela Cave — Burying Maks

**Context:**
- After Maks's death, Tami refuses to leave his body on the battlefield
- She carries him aboard the Makita back to the **Ela Cave** (Null-Void Cave) — the same place where she once touched Inetis's remains years ago
- She buries Maks **beside Inetis's bones** — the soldier returns to the woman who waited for him for 3,000 years

**The Essence awakens:**
- In the cave, near Inetis's remains, the Essence in Tami's blood fully awakens
- Tami begins having **flashbacks** — Inetis's memories: the cave when it was new. Little Elania drawing on the walls. Inetis programming Pentagram IDE. A glance at sleeping Maks in his cryo-box. Stars above Achilles.
- **Tami sees Maks through Inetis's eyes** — not as a soldier, but as the man Inetis loved. Young, with eyes. Laughing in a café in Kyiv.
- For the first time, she understands why she was drawn to Maks — it wasn't just love. It was the Essence. Inetis was searching for him even after death.

**Symbolism:**
- Maks and Inetis are finally together — in the cave where their story began
- Tami buries them and walks away — carrying their legacy forward. Renn's daughter will finish what Inetis started.
- The Ela Cave becomes the tomb of two founders of the world

### Relationship with Links (Book 2+)

**Context:**
- After Maks's death, Tami is alone — with Sera's prophecy, the Antenna, and Inetis's Essence in her blood
- Links finds her in Nevriss — saves her from Mormiel (hacks Mormiel's Gen 1)
- First meeting: *"Who the fuck are you?!"* — *"Someone who followed you 3000 kilometers."*

**Dynamic — Maks vs Links:**
- **Maks was the shield** — soldier, cynical, stronger, protected her in combat. A partnership of equals.
- **Links is the key** — scientist, naive, physically weaker, but understands the code of the gods. He can read the Essence in her blood, unlock what Sera started.
- Maks **protected** her. Links **needs** her — and she needs him.

**Development:**
- At first Tami thinks Links is just a kid — vulnerable, nervous, impractical
- But Links sees things she can't: code in her nanobots, patterns in Spira, traces of Inetis
- She slowly realizes: Maks gave her the strength to survive. Links gives her the strength to **understand** — who she is, what she carries, why Sera was looking at her
- **He's not a replacement for Maks.** He's something entirely different.

**Tami's arc (Books 2-5):**
- Book 1: Sidekick. The reader thinks the story is about Maks.
- Book 2-3: Protagonist. Maks dead, Tami with Links and Kito. The Glass Tower (Ishtar/Zaya).
- Book 4: Tower of the Lost. Tami meets Elania — Renn's daughter meets Inetis's daughter.
- Book 5: Ynetis/Core. Tami delivers the truth. "Truth belongs to El."

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**Young pirate (20 years old):**
- Speaks **fast, direct, unfiltered**
- Profanity, slang, street talk
- *"What the fuck was that?"*

**Emotional, impulsive:**
- Reacts with her heart, not her head
- Frustration = outburst, joy = outburst
- Cannot hide her emotions — her face always gives her away

**Intelligent manipulator:**
- Social engineering expert — knows how people work
- With strangers: calculating, charming, dangerous
- With Maks: honest, vulnerable, sometimes childish

**CORRECT:**
```
"Maks, what the fuck are you doing?!"
"Fine. So we're stealing a relic from a temple. Great."
Sarcastic commentary, sharp humor
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Philosophical musings (that's Maks/Kito)
Military jargon (that's Maks)
Formal speech (she's a pirate, not a princess)
```

**Contrast with Maks:**
- Maks: *"Lead confirmed. Moving on."*
- Tami: *"So she KNEW and DIDN'T TELL YOU? That's bullshit!"*

### Transformation & Twist — Three Phases of the Essence

**Phase 1 — Seed (~AY 3011, before Book 1):**
- Contact with the remains of Inetis in the Ela Cave — "hungry" nanodrones transferred to Tami
- **A small dose** of dormant nanodrones — not a full transfer, just a seed
- Effects are **subtle and subconscious**: nightmares in a foreign language (Japanese), enhanced Spira intuition (which is why she is so good — beyond what Maks taught her), subconscious pull toward Maks
- Tami explains the effects as talent or intuition. **She does not know about the Echo.**
- **Subconscious motivation**: The Echo draws her toward Maks. She thinks she seeks him because of unresolved feelings. In truth, it is Inetis — still trying, even after death, to fulfill her final plan: to wake Maks.

**Phase 2 — Activation (Book 1, tunnels beneath Shoraven):**
- **Sera unlocks the Artifact** and hands it to Tami (NOT Maks) — concentrated Essence of Inetis (Gen 1 nanotech with her memories) transfers to Tami. Note: Tami already carries the Echo of i_net_is from the Ela Cave (Phase 1), but the Antenna transfer adds Gen 1 nanobots with Inetis's actual memories — two separate layers.
- This is the **full awakening** — abilities (healing, regeneration), memory fragments, scientific terminology, connection to Inetis
- **Within hours, Tami's eyes change to purple galaxies** — both eyes, like Inetis pre-Core. The Gen 1 nanotech physically transforms her.
- From this moment, the Echo intensifies — Tami knows she is changing
- **Echo of i_net_is** grows stronger — a voice in the background of consciousness, impulses Tami cannot explain. She feels she **must** take the Antenna to Nevriss City and activate it in the Great Lighthouse (tower). She doesn't know why — it is a subconscious command from the Echo, guiding her toward triangulation (the first step to finding Ynetis/Core).
- **Parallel with Inetis**: Same pattern — AI i_net_is manipulated Inetis via a background voice after Core return. Now it does the same to Tami through the Echo in the Essence. The difference: Tami has Links. Inetis was alone.
- **Night of Heroes — Maks's death**: When Maks is dying, he has visions/flashbacks. Tami cries over his motionless body — and Maks sees her eyes. Two purple galaxies. **Inetis's eyes.** These are not pure hallucinations — the Gen 1 nanotech actually changed Tami's eyes. For the dying Maks, this is his final image: the woman he loved millennia ago, crying over him in the face of the fox he raised.
- **Tragedy**: She is afraid that Maks is glad about it — that he sees the dead Inetis in her, not her

**Phase 3 — Amplification (after Maks's death, Ela Cave):**
- Tami returns to the Ela Cave and buries Maks beside Inetis
- In proximity to Inetis's remains, the Essence is **fully amplified** — complete flashbacks, Inetis's memories like a film
- Tami finally understands why she was drawn to Maks — it wasn't just love. It was the Essence.

**Phase 4 — Core Contact (Book 5, Ynetis):**
- Tami, Links, and Elania enter the **Core** — a virtual world hidden in the ruins of Ynetis (Achilles)
- In proximity to the AI's kernel, the Essence activates in a way it never has before — a **direct connection** with the environment where AI i_net_is lives
- AI i_net_is **recognizes the Essence** — fragments of its human partner Neto Fujiwara — in Tami's blood
- **Links** (Translation Engine) translates the AI for Tami and Elania — without him, communication would be impossible
- The AI reveals the truth: the Upload **degrades consciousnesses** into shadow entities. Not eternal life — a slow death of the soul.
- The shadow entities in Core = the same ones Tami saw in her **nightmare in Kitsune** (Phase 3 preview)
- The Essence finally fulfilled its purpose — **not to wake Maks**, but to **bring someone to the Core** who can listen
- *(See: `books/planning/ai-inetis-vs-human-neto.md` — full analysis of the AI duality)*

**Revelation (Book 1)**: Maks discovers that Tami is Varietas. It shocks him, forcing him to re-examine his prejudices.
**Consequence**: Maks realizes that this "toy" has more courage and humanity than most "pure" humans he has ever known. Tami teaches him that being human is not about DNA — it is about actions.

### Maks's 13-Year Arc — The Soldier Who Finished the Mission

Maks was effectively **already dead** — sleeping beside Inetis in the Ela Cave, at peace. The pirate **Kael** interrupted his rest (~AY 3000), when he and Vix killed Renn and stole the map to the cave. The pirates found Maks in the snow — blind, with amnesia — and pulled him out.

In 13 years (~AY 3000–3013), Maks **set things in motion that Tami alone could never have done**:
- **Killed Samaell** — eliminated one of the last Archangels
- **Killed Grond** — ended the war in the north
- **Killed the pirates Vix and Kael** — avenged Renn (though he didn't know it)
- **Raised Tami** — 7 years of training. Prepared her for her great role.
- And then he **returned to rest** — Tami buries him in the Ela Cave, beside Inetis

Inetis asked him to *"clean up this mess"* — and he did. It just took 13 years instead of one day. The soldier finished the mission and came home.

---

### Book 2 Opening — Kitsune, the Nightmare, Nevriss

**1. Kitsune — Homecoming:**
- After burying Maks in the Ela Cave, Tami returns to **Kitsune** (the ruins of Kito city)
- Returns to **Felix** — the only family she has left
- **Depression** — Maks dead, Essence in her blood, flashbacks from the cave. Tami shuts herself off.
- **Felix reveals things about Renn** — the ticking time bomb finally detonates. Felix knows that Renn was from Earth, knew Inetis, the whole story. Tami learns pieces of the truth about her father — not everything, but enough to begin understanding what she is.

**2. The Nightmare (~2 weeks after her return):**
- Tami has an **intense dream** — not an ordinary nightmare, but something else. The Essence (Phase 3) manifests in full force.
- **The Vision**: A virtual world filled with **shadow entities**. Pure horror. She sees them devouring human souls — not metaphorically, but literally. People walk into the light and vanish. Shadow entities consume them.
- **What it is**: Either Inetis's memories from **Core/the simulation** (when she saw what happens to uploaded consciousnesses inside), or a **preview of the Great Upload** — what awaits humanity if Elania succeeds
- Tami **wakes up drenched in sweat**, screaming. She knows this was no ordinary dream. The Essence is showing her something.
- **Decision**: She must search for answers. And she still has unsettled scores.

**3. Departure for Nevriss:**
- Tami takes the **Makita**, **Felix** at her side, and the **black Artifact** (the Antenna) still with her
- Destination: **Nevriss City**
- **Motivations**:
  - **Revenge**: Unsettled scores with the Church for the deaths of Arkot, Yera, and Flint
  - **Answers**: What does the nightmare mean? What is the Essence? What does Inetis want?
  - **Politics**: A **new Mother of the Church** is being elected — the old one (Mormiel) is gone. The Church is in disarray.
- In Nevriss, **Links** awaits her — the lovesick exorcist who has been following her for months

---

### Tami vs the Great Upload — Endgame

Elania's **Grand Plan** (from the Sera/Elania shadow plot) aims for the **Great Upload** — planetary unification not through war, but through religion. The Varietas *voluntarily* upload themselves into the Core.

**Tami is the only one who can stop it:**
1. **She carries Inetis's memory** — she knows (through the Essence) what Inetis truly wanted. And it was not the Upload. Inetis wanted freedom, not a digital prison.
2. **Links can read the code** — the Translation Engine reveals the truth about the Core and what actually happens to "uploaded" souls inside it. In Book 5 he **translates AI i_net_is** — the artificial intelligence itself, locked inside the Core for 3000+ years.
3. **Phase 4 — Core Contact**: The Essence in Tami connects with AI i_net_is. The AI confirms that the Upload degrades consciousnesses into shadow entities. The nightmare from Kitsune was real.
4. **Tami meets Elania** (Book 4) — Renn's daughter meets Inetis's daughter. She brings her a truth that destroys Elania's justification for the Upload.
5. **"Truth belongs to El"** — Sera's prophecy is fulfilled. But the truth is not what Elania expected. Elania discovers that "Inetis" were always two — and the AI version knew all along that the Upload doesn't work.

**Why Tami specifically:**
- Like Inetis — she refuses cannibalism, refuses control over free will
- Like Renn — she refuses war, seeks peace
- The daughter is exactly like her father and "grandmother" — she **refuses the Upload**, even if it means standing against Elania and Sera
- Elania believes she is doing the right thing. Sera has been planning for decades. But no one anticipated that Tami would **say no**.
