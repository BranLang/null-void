### Not a Chosen One (but looks like one)

Maks is not the chosen one. He's not a god. He's just a man who woke up after 3000 years. The world worked without him for three whole millennia — nations rose and fell, civilizations changed, people lived and died. "The Legend of the Sleeper" is just a legend — like any other. Nobody was waiting for him, nobody needs him. He needs to understand the world.

**Trope awareness:** Maks *looks* like a chosen one trope — back on Earth he was No. 3-4 in the hierarchy, Darth Vader, the Coordinator's right hand. That's intentional. Inetis needed someone special by her side — not an ordinary bodyguard with no history. Maks is "chosen" only in Inetis's eyes, not in the world's. The world doesn't know about him and doesn't care. The difference between a classic chosen one and Maks: the world won't collapse without him. Maks is the chosen one of one dead woman — not of prophecy.

**If he died** — for example during the encounter with the Paladins or the battle of Shoraven — Tami would mourn him and move on. She'd meet Links, they'd live together. The Great Upload probably wouldn't happen — it depends on who gets the Antenna and what they use it for. The world wouldn't collapse. The story continues — just in a different direction.

### "Broken God" Phase (Year 0-1)
Maks awakens as a wreck.
- **Year of Shadows (The Blind Interval)**: For the first year he sees only blurred shapes. He hears Tami's voice and senses her presence, but his arrogant mind automatically fills in the image of a "human" descendant. He builds a deep respect for her based on her leadership skills and care, unaware of what species she is.

- **Maks's imprisonment:** During the 3-year FTL journey aboard the NULL VOID, Maks attacked Inetis. This trauma is why Inetis put him into cryostasis after landing — she tricked him into believing they didn't have enough supplies and both had to sleep. Maks was only a **passenger** and didn't know about the ship's true capabilities. Inetis was afraid of him and wanted him gone. She couldn't kill him (she knew the world would need him), but she couldn't bring herself to wake him either. **300 years stretched into 3000.**
- **The Revelation**: The moment his sight fully returns in a busy port. The shock of discovering the truth about the Varietas and that **"Initiative Achilles" was one big lie**. Realizing that the Archangels didn't protect the world but hollowed it out, and that his sacrifice on Earth was pointless, triggers his psychological collapse and transformation into a cynical Exorcist.
- **Linguistic Isolation**: Speaks **Old Speech** (21st-century English). He depends on translation through a Mako.

### Abilities and Equipment
- **Military-Grade Nanotech**: His drones are aggressive combat variants that slowly "burn him out."
- **Assassin de Luxe**: Originally a gaming role as an assassin (**maXpowa**), in which he came of age over 15 subjective years in the digital hell of 2060. His skills (stealth combat, combat drone manipulation) are conditioned reflexes from the simulation.

- **Ex Inferis Trauma**: His consciousness is scarred by the loss of temporal linearity.

- **Equipment**:
  - **Submachine Gun** — an old relic from the pre-Fall era. Maks's primary combat weapon. Loaded with **nano-drone-coated rounds** — bullets sheathed in nanodust collected from exorcised Wraiths over years of work as an Exorcist. Standard ammunition for regular combat. Ineffective against the Paladins' Hard Light shields.
  - **Weapon escalation:** Submachine gun (regular combat) then Black Dust swarm (when ammunition runs out or under extreme threat). Black Dust = the ultimate weapon, a raw nanodrone swarm from his eyes/body. Heavy artillery.
  - **Antenna** — the only physical remnant of the NULL VOID. When Inetis disassembled the ship into nanodrones, the Antenna was the only thing she didn't break down because she needed it to build Elysium. Controls Wraith goo swarms, receives signals. Maks's cryobox crumbled to dust after awakening — the Antenna is the last thing that exists from the ship besides THE CORE.
    - **Inetis's Tool:** Using the Antenna, Inetis built all of Elysium. The Antenna is needed as an amplifier for large nanobot swarms. Statues of Inetis are sometimes depicted as a pilgrim with a staff — that's the Antenna.
    - **Infiltration:** The Antenna allowed her to travel freely between Nevriss and Elysium, even when the city was lost to everyone else.
    - **Why everyone wants it:** The only object on the planet capable of controlling large nanobot swarms. The Archangels, the Church, Grond, the Apes — everyone wants it. (Nobody knows how it works, except Elania — her mother taught her.)
  - **Black Nano Suit** — every time he deactivates a Wraith, he crafts a small piece of indestructible armor from the dust. That's why he always wears a black nano suit.

- **Enlightened**: Maks doesn't believe in the supernatural. He considers religion a psychological weapon for mass control. He understands Spira as pure technology — and he's right. He doesn't have Spira himself because **Inetis never blessed him** (she put him to sleep before she could). Unlike the descendants of her team, who still live on Terra's southern coast.
- **Black Dust Eyes**: After defeating Samaell, Maks claimed his nanodrones ("Shadow Dust"). The Black Dust filled his empty eye sockets and formed functional eyes from black nanodust. They are not "seven blue stars" — they are eyes made of pure Dust, dark and unnatural.
- **Cover Identity — Exorcist (Technomant)**: Maks presents himself as an Exorcist while traveling. In Nevriss and other cities, he operates under this identity. Exorcists are technomants who eliminate Wraiths — for Maks, it's ideal cover for his true objectives.
- **Exorcism and Dust Crafting**: Maks can "exorcise" Wraiths — extract nanodrones (Dust) from them and craft physical objects from the collected Dust. This process is extremely resource-intensive:
  - **Conversion ratio**: ~10 Wraiths = 1 small object (ring, knife)
  - **Products**: rings, pieces of armor, amulets, minor artifacts
  - **Livelihood**: This is how he earns a living as an Exorcist — hunting Wraiths, collecting Dust, and selling crafted goods

### Backstory
Maks is one of the chosen who returned from 50 years of imprisonment in a VR hell (*ex inferis*). That hell transformed him into an extremely driven and ruthless architect of utopia.
- **In reality**: Maks was the son of a **war veteran** from Central Europe. From his father he learned discipline and the basics of combat, but in the Era of the Players he preferred the virtual world over harsh reality.
- **War with Mars**: He was the Coordinator's main fist. A loyal, tough, devoted Major during the war (2150). After victory, promoted to **General of Earth Defense**.
- **Fall of Earth**: He spent the final hours fighting his way through a burning civilization to rescue Inetis on the dying Coordinator's orders.
- **Awakening (AY 3000)**: Awakened in a "Tomb of Technology" after 2700 years. Cryostasis failure caused his eyes to explode from frost. Found by pirates and sold as "purebred stock."
- **Condition**: Naked, covered in blue cryo-fluid, blind and in shock.
- **Samaell's Defeat and Eyes of Dust**: After defeating Samaell, Maks claimed his nanodrones — "Shadow Dust." The Black Dust filled his empty eye sockets and formed new, functional eyes. Maks's eyes are now made of black nanodust — dark, unnatural, but fully functional. They are not "seven blue stars" — they are eyes made from the Dust of a dead demon.

### Gaming Past
> "In 'Achilles' it didn't matter. There I was 'maXpowa,' a tank who covered her back while she built impossible cities."

### Motivation
1.  **Revenge (Tami)**: Help Tami avenge the death of her first crew (Arkot, Yera, Flint), who died because of the Artifact. He feels guilty for not being there.
2.  **Exodus (Null Void)**: Obtain the Artifact (Antenna) not for the Church, but for himself. He needs it to locate his ship *Null Void*. He knows it's somewhere west of Kito, but in that wasteland he can't find it without a sensor.
3.  **Inetis**: He hopes the Antenna will reveal Inetis's fate. His secret, irrational hope is that she's *still alive* in cryostasis aboard the ship.
4.  **Save his daughter Elania**: (Long-term goal).

### Inner Conflict & Attitude
- **Xenophobia**: When he wakes and sees the Varietas, he feels revulsion. To him they're not a "new race" but walking monuments to decadence ("depraved toys of billionaires"). He treats them with condescension and distrust.
- **Guilt**: "I slept while they suffered."

### Speech and Thinking Style

**Military strategist:**
- Thinks in **facts and data**, not emotions
- Processes situations as **tactical problems**
- Inner monologue: short sentences, analysis, assessment
- *"Lead. Incomplete, but a lead. Assessment: proceed."*

**Numbed emotions:**
- Has seen more death than anyone else on the planet
- Emotions are a **luxury** he cannot afford
- When he feels something strong, he **registers it** — doesn't experience it
- *"Hands trembled slightly. Registered. Continued."*

**Pragmatic communicator:**
- Speaks only when necessary
- Short, punchy sentences
- No unnecessary explaining
- *"She knows. Won't say."* (not *"She knows, but she won't tell me, which is frustrating..."*)

**FORBIDDEN for Maks:**
```
"His heart pounded. He felt something crack inside."
"WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL ME?!" (caps lock emotional outburst)
Long poetic reflections on loss
Teenage crush reactions to women
```

**CORRECT:**
```
"Hands trembled. Registered. Control restored."
"Past tense. Processed. Archived. Insufficient data."
"Lead. First one in thirteen years. Acceptable."
Short pragmatic assessments
```

**Exception — Inetis:**
- The only topic where emotions break through his control
- But even then: controlled, not hysterical
- Frustration yes, desperation no
- *"She knows. Won't say."* = the maximum emotion he'll show

### Inner Motifs (Bury The Light)
Maks's inner monologue echoes the song **Bury The Light** — his subconscious mantra that defines his journey.

> *"I am the storm that is approaching / Provoking black clouds in isolation"*
