### Origin and Character

Renn was **Renn Ólafsson** — an Icelander, a human from Earth, one of ~100 survivors from ARK-11. A member of Inetis's Core Team and founder of the city of Kito. He was a quiet, stubborn man with unforgettable blue eyes, a sharp instinct for danger and an even sharper one for opportunity. He spent his whole life on the road — searching for lost artifacts, ancient ruins, and forgotten technologies to sell to guilds and collectors.

### Renn and Felix — A Millennial Friendship

- **Founding of Kito (~AY 850)**: Renn **founded** the city of Kito (Kitana) — he led the surviving fox families to secret coordinates given by Inetis after the Great Battle. The city grew, prospered. Renn was its unofficial leader.
- **Third Arrival (AY 2212)**: The ship **Hephaestus** landed at the site carrying thousands of Maki. The foxes welcomed them as "Messengers of the Mother." Among the Maki was **Felix** (E-Series — European series). Renn was there — he had been waiting for this moment for 1300 years.
- **The Blood Lesson (AY 2212)**: The Maki activated a fusion reactor. It attracted a massive cyclone of Wraiths that devastated the city. The city of millions was reduced to ruins. Felix survived — he had been working deep underground. Several thousand foxes survived.
- **Friendship**: Renn and Felix have known each other since the Third Arrival. Both from Earth — Renn as a human from Earth (human from ARK-11), Felix as a Mako (from Hephaestus). Felix knows who Renn is, where he came from, his entire story. It was a friendship between a man and a machine — unexpected, but deep.
- **Felix's solitude**: After the Blood Lesson and Renn's renewed departure into the world, Felix remained in the ruins of Kito alone — centuries of solitude, faithful to his Directive: *"Survive. Build. Help humanity."* Renn visited him occasionally.
- **Return (~AY 2900)**: Renn returned permanently. Felix repaired him, Renn brought parts. Together they made a home in the ruins. This is where Tami was later born (~AY 2993). She grew up surrounded by ruins, machines, and Felix's stories about the old world.

### Makita — The Greatest Ship on Terra

- **Origin of the Ship**: **Felix and other Maki** built **Makita** for Renn — a larger project, not the work of a single machine. They used remnants of technology from the ship Hephaestus, combined with local materials. Makita was a prototype of the fourth series of hawk-class airships — small, fast, but with one revolutionary detail: a **Spira crystal drive**. While most airships burn expensive biodiesel or ethanol, Makita needs only water and a few Spira crystals at a fraction of the cost.
- **Name**: *Makita* = "Little Machine" — a tribute to Felix and his race (Maki). Renn named her.
- **Felix 88**: Felix also installed his masterpiece on the ship — the **88mm cannon "Felix"**, a heavy artillery piece of his own making. A legend among gunsmiths.
- **Why "Greatest"**: Makita isn't the largest by dimensions — she's a small, fast ship. But thanks to the Spira drive, she has **unlimited range** and **minimal operating costs**. In a world where fuel costs a fortune, that's an invaluable advantage. No other ship on Terra has this technology.

### The Ancient Map

- **True Author**: The map was drawn by **Renn himself** ~2000 years ago (~AY 850), when he was saying farewell to Inetis at the Cave of Ela (Cave of Beginning). He drew it so he would not forget the way back — he promised to return and bury his friend.
- **Lost and Found**: The map was lost during Renn's millennial wanderings. It passed through dozens of hands before ending up in an antique shop on the black market. Renn discovered it (~AY 2995) — he recognized his own handwriting, his own symbols. To the world it was a worthless scrap in Old Speech. To Renn it was a **sign** — after millennia the map had returned to him.
- **The Decision**: Renn decided to finally fulfill an old promise — take Tami on an adventure trip and bury Inetis.
- **Pirates Tracked Renn**: Vix and Kael learned about the map — there were whispers on the black market about "a fox-man with an ancient map." They followed Renn through the Eastern Wilds, waiting for an opportunity.

### Renn's Death (AY 3000)

- **Ambush**: Pirates Vix and Kael ambushed Renn in the Eastern Wilds near the city of Kito. Renn was alone — and **careless**, because he was looking after little Tami. His attention was on his daughter, not his surroundings. It cost him his life.
- **Murder**: They killed him for the **Ancient Map** — a document whose true value not even Renn himself knew. The pirates didn't know exactly what the map showed, but they knew that ancient maps in Old Speech could be sold for a fortune — or better yet, followed.
- **Map Leads to the Cave**: Kael and Vix followed the map and reached the area of the **Cave of Beginning**. Kael's Dust (nanobots in his blood) activated the cryobox sensors and triggered the process of Maks's awakening — a chain reaction no one had planned.
- **Tami's Capture**: After Renn's death, Vix and Kael returned to Kito, where they captured 7-year-old Tami. Felix was not in the ruins (he was away on one of his scavenging trips for parts). Tami was alone.

## Vix and Kael (Pirates)

| **Nature** | Pragmatic flesh traders and slavers |
| **Ship** | **Makita** — stolen from Renn after his murder. Originally built by Felix and other Maki for Renn |

### Role in the Story

- Killed **Renn** (Tami's father) and captured 7-year-old Tami, keeping her in a cage on the ship's deck
- **Kael and the Cave of Beginning**: Thanks to the **Ancient Map** stolen from Renn, Kael reached the area of the Cave of Ela (Tomb of Technology). His presence — specifically his Dust (nanobots in his blood) — activated the cryobox sensors and triggered the process of Maks's awakening
- **Kael vs. Samaell**: Kael's Dust drew the attention of **Samaell**, who was hunting in the area. Kael and Samaell clashed in a brutal Dust duel — two wills trying to boil each other alive. Kael was experienced, but Samaell was an Archangel. The duel was interrupted by **defensive nanodrones from the cave** (the cryobox Caretaker responded to a perimeter breach) — the interference gave Kael a second to escape. Badly wounded, he crawled into a hole near the cave.
- **Maks's Awakening and Kael's Death**: Maks awoke in pain and fury — 3,000 years of cryostasis, exploded eyes, disorientation. In this state, his nanodrones automatically eliminated the nearest threat — the wounded Kael hiding nearby. Maks **does not remember** this death — he was in a trance between unconsciousness and awakening. Kael died as collateral damage of a process he didn't understand.
- **Vix Finds Maks**: Vix, searching for Kael, found a half-dead Maks in the snow near the cave instead — naked, covered in blue cryo-fluid, blind. He threw him into the hold with Tami to sell him in the mines down south for gold. *"Blind, but muscular. Good for the mines."*
- **Maks and Tami meet on the ship** — he blind and unconscious, she in a cage

### Kael — Detail

- **Dust Duelist**: Kael had strong Dust (above-average nanobot concentration). He was a veteran of street duels, but his abilities were nothing compared to an Archangel. Samaell could have killed him instantly, but wanted to "feel him out" first — to figure out where such a strong Dust signal was coming from in this wasteland.
- **Death**: Twofold — badly wounded by Samaell, finished off by Maks's nanodrones in automatic defense mode. Samaell later found his desiccated body near the cave and paid it no attention — he was only interested in the empty cryobox and the vanished "General Maksimilian."
