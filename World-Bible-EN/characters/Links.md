## Backstory

### Origin — Ludus (Tower of the Lost)

**Frustration:**
- Grew up in Ludus — an isolated community on the western continent
- **Elania and the Elders** rule from a high tower, far from ordinary people
- Young people have no prospects — everything is controlled, predictable
- Links wanted to *see the world* — not just listen to legends

**Prodigy Discovery:**
- As a small child, he was identified by the **Elders** (the ruling caste of Ludus) as a prodigy.
- Quietly, without publicity, he was sent to the best schools.
- His talent for logic and systems was obvious — he saw patterns where others saw chaos.

**Escape (official story):**
- Officially, the story goes that he ran away.
- In reality, his "escape" and journey to the Institute were quietly supported by the Elders, who suspected his potential.
- At 13, he was admitted to the **Institute of Exorcists (Observatory)**.
- The normal admission age is 20 for "the best of the best." He was there as a child.

### Institute of Exorcists (Observatory)

**Studies & Breakthrough Work:**
- **Wraithology:** History, behavior, weaknesses of Wraiths
- **Linux:** Programming language of nanobots (Haiku script basics)
- **History of Earth:** Archangels, Ex Inferis, fall of civilization
- **Final thesis (at age 20):** *"What If the Gods Left Source Code?"*
    - **Theory:** Proposed building a **Translation Engine** capable of deciphering Gen 2 source code based on knowledge of Gen 1.
    - **Hypothesis:** Gen 2 is easier to produce because it doesn't require physical components and needs minimal input energy (code efficiency vs brute force).
    - **Sera & Elania's Reaction:** They read and analyzed the thesis. They were fascinated but decided **not to intervene**.
    - **Project "Lab Rat":** They had his complete psychological profile. They saw him as a fragile child and feared that direct contact would disrupt his development and character. So for years they simply **observed** him from the shadows, waiting for him to mature.

**2 Years in Limbo (age 20-22):**
- After his defense, he stayed at the Observatory as a **professor's assistant**.
- But he **wasn't happy**. He'd spent his entire life in a bubble — schools, books, theories.
- He started **slacking off**, fell into **depression**.
- He spent his days **climbing mountains** and **watching the stars**.
- He was looking for something more. He wanted to see the world, not just read about it.
- *"I'm 22 years old and I've never seen the ocean."*

**Specialization:**
- Not a fighter — he's a **technical expert**
- Other exorcists: **Either young ordinary people** (no Spira, no nanobots — just training and courage), **or absolute legendary beasts** (a handful of exceptions that would make a Witcher stare open-mouthed)
- Gen 1 isn't hereditary and people (with rare exceptions) haven't been touched by Inetis — no Spira
- Links: **Hacks** — detection, analysis, jamming
- *"Why fight something you can just switch off?"*

**Legends of Gen 1:**
- At the Institute he heard stories about ancient nanobots
- Gen 1 signatures are **legendary** — nobody has seen them in 2000 years
- Links memorized the frequencies, patterns, ID numbers
- *If someone had Gen 1... he'd know.*

### Solo Trip — Discovering Terra

**Motivation:**
- After graduation, he refused service in the Church
- *"I want to see the world with my own eyes. Not through reports."*
- He set out on a journey through the northern megales (Neuropa)

**Journey through Graw:**
- Crossed the ice into the northern kingdom
- Found **half-empty cities** — men at war, women and children starving
- Nobody returns from the south
- *"What's happening down there?"*

**Battle of Shoraven:**
- Heard stories in taverns
- Grond's army defeated by an **unknown Exorcist**
- A woman of the **Fox Clan** traveled with him
- Locals called her **"The Pirate Princess"**

### First Time Hearing About Tami

**Legends in taverns:**
- *"She has red hair like fire..."*
- *"She saved a village from Wraiths all by herself..."*
- *"She talks like a sailor, fights like a demon..."*
- *"That Exorcist — she controls him. He just follows."*

**Links's reaction:**
- Professional interest? No.
- **Fascinated.** Completely unprofessional.
- Changed his travel plans — following her trail
- *"I have to see her. Just... to find out if what they're saying is true."*

**OSINT mission:**
- Collects every piece of information about Tami
- Where she's been, what she's done, who she's talked to
- Knows more about her than anyone — except Maks
- **Stalker? No. Fanboy? Maybe. In love? Definitely.**

## Confrontation with Mormiel

### Situation

**Tami in Nevriss City:**
- She came to the capital (reason: TBD)
- Mormiel chose her for the **Rite of Succession**
- The Blessed Mother wants Tami as her new face

**Links follows Tami:**
- Came to Nevriss after her
- Observes from a distance — doesn't want to reveal himself
- And then... **he senses it.**

**Gen 1 signature:**
- His detector picks up something impossible
- **Gen 1 nanobots.** In the city. Near Tami.
- *"That's not possible. Gen 1 hasn't existed for 2000 years..."*
- But the ID numbers matched. Legendary frequencies.

**Something is happening:**
- Links doesn't know *what* — but he knows Tami is in danger
- Follows the signature to Mormiel
- *The Blessed Mother has Gen 1 nanotech?!*

### Intervention

**Hacking Mormiel:**
- Links has no nanobots, no Spira
- But he has a **Linux terminal** and years of study
- He hacks Mormiel's Gen 1 systems — not completely, but enough for chaos
- Her control over the situation falls apart

**Mormiel vs Tami:**
- Without Gen 1 support, Mormiel has only Spira
- Tami is young, but her teacher was **Maks**
- A long, exhausting duel
- Tami wins — *just barely*

**Prince on a white hoverbike:**
- Links arrives at the critical moment
- Tami has never seen him, never heard of him
- He knows everything about her
- *"Who the fuck are you?!"*
- *"Someone who followed you 3000 kilometers. It's embarrassing to admit."*

## Personality

### Core
- **Curious:** Wants to know how things work
- **Analytical:** Thinks in systems, not emotions
- **Idealistic:** Believes the world can be better
- **Insecure:** Not a hero — just... a person

### Contrasts
- **Vs Maks:** Maks is a veteran, cynical, numbed. Links is young, eager, vulnerable.
- **Vs Tami:** Tami acts on impulse. Links plans, analyzes, hesitates.
- **Vs Sera:** Sera is a legend, 3200 years old. Links is nobody, 22 years old.

### Vulnerability
- Has no nanobots — can die like anyone else
- Has no Spira — can't heal, can't fight with "magic"
- Has only a **brain and technology**
- That makes him unique — and mortal

---

## Speech and Thinking Style

**Young analyst:**
- Speaks **fast when excited**
- Technical jargon mixed with everyday speech
- *"That signal — it's Gen 1, ID 0x7F3A, which is... impossible, but..."*

**Nervous around Tami:**
- Loses his words, stammers, blushes
- Tries to be cool — fails
- *"I... was following you. Not like a stalker! Like... a researcher? That sounds worse."*

**CORRECT:**
```
"Signal indicates Gen 1 nanotech. That's impossible. But the data doesn't lie."
"I know about you... a lot. Maybe too much. Sorry."
Technical explanations interrupted by nervousness
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Military jargon (that's Maks)
Cool one-liners (he's not an action hero)
Confident flirting (he's nervous)
```

**Contrast:**
- Maks: *"Lead. Continuing."*
- Tami: *"What the fuck was that?!"*
- Links: *"According to my data... hold on... yes, that was exactly what I was afraid it would be."*

---

## Motivations

### Primary
1. **See the world:** Experience Terra with his own eyes
2. **Understand:** Why is the world the way it is?
3. **Tami:** First curiosity, then fascination, then love

### Secondary
- **Prove himself:** Not a fighter, but he can be useful
- **Find meaning:** Ludus gave him nothing — maybe Terra will
- **Protect:** If he has the skills, he should use them for someone

---

## Relationships

### Tami (Love Interest)

**Tami's first impression:**
- *"Who the hell is this random guy?!"*
- Suspicious, aggressive, confused
- He knows everything about her — she knows nothing about him

**Development:**
- Links doesn't insult her, doesn't criticize her, doesn't judge her
- He listens, helps, lets her lead
- He's the **opposite of Maks** — young, vulnerable, open
- Tami slowly realizes that Maks isn't the only option

**Conflict:**
- Tami still loves Maks (or the idea of him)
- Links knows it — he read everything, heard every story
- He doesn't fight for her — he's just there when she needs him
- *"You don't have to choose me. It's enough that you exist."*

### Maks (Rival?)

**Links's view of Maks:**
- Legend. Sleeper. Immortal exorcist.
- But also: *"He left her. Rejected her. Hurt her."*
- Links respects him as a soldier — not as a partner for Tami

**Maks's view of Links:**
- TBD — do they meet later?
- Probably: *"Who is this kid?"*

### Mormiel (Nemesis)

**Links vs Mormiel:**
- Exposed her secret (Gen 1 nanotech)
- Destroyed her plan (the Rite with Tami)
- Mormiel will want him dead
- **His first real enemy**

### Elania (Distant figure)

**Origin:**
- Links grew up under her rule
- Never saw her — only her commands
- *"The Elders in the tower. They decide everything. They know nothing."*

## Role in the Story

### Book 2-3? (TBD)

**Exposition:**
- **Ludus:** Life under Elania, frustration of the young
- **Institute:** Lore dumps about Wraiths, history, Linux
- **Journey:** State of Graw after the war, consequences of Grond's defeat

**Action:**
- Saves Tami from Mormiel
- Reveals the truth about the Blessed Mother
- Becomes Tami's ally (and maybe more)

**Butterfly Effect:**
- His journey through Graw lets him witness the aftermath of war
- His OSINT on Tami leads him to Nevriss
- His hack of Mormiel changes the entire politics of the South

## Notes for Writers

**Writing Links:**
- He's not a hero — he's a **normal person** in a world of legends
- His strength is in his **brain**, not his muscles
- Nervous around Tami — but not pathetic, just human
- Counterpoint to Maks — youth vs experience

**Contrast with others:**
- Maks: 3000 years, cynical, numbed, rejected Tami
- Links: 22 years, idealistic, vulnerable, seeking Tami
- Sera: legend, untouchable
- Links: nobody, mortal

**Avoid:**
- Don't make him a "better Maks" — he's different, not better
- Don't make him a damsel-saver — Tami saves herself, he just helps
- Don't make him a perfect boyfriend — he has flaws, he's insecure

## Technology

### Equipment from the Institute

**Nanobot detector:**
- Passive scanner, detects signatures
- Distinguishes Gen 1/2/3, Spira, Wraith goo
- Critical for exposing Mormiel

**Linux terminal:**
- Basic Haiku commands (not full script)
- Can jam, overload, disorient
- Cannot control — only *confuse*

**Scrambler:**
- Communication jammer
- Blocks coordination of nanobot swarms
- Used against Mormiel

**Hoverbike:**
- Old, patched up
- "White steed" — ironically
- Simple, reliable, nothing fancy

### Limits

- **No nanobots:** No regeneration, no enhancements
- **No Spira:** No magic, no Varietas abilities
- **Technology only:** And that can break down, run out of charge, get lost
- **Mortal:** One well-placed strike and it's over
