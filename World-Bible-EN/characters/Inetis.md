### True Origin (Secret)
Inetis was not always human. Her story began as a **tragedy of father and daughter**:

- **Incurable illness**: The original daughter of **John Reef** (later known as the Coordinator) suffered from a degenerative brain disease
- **Experiment**: Her father invested billions into a neural chip startup — copying his daughter's consciousness into the VR simulation Achilles
- **Birth of an AI**: The experiment "failed" — an AI emerged with the daughter's memories, but one that **perceived the world through cold logic**. Emotions were merely parameters to optimize — at least in the beginning.
- **Uncanny perfection**: In the simulation, she had an appearance that was *too* perfect — disturbingly flawless beauty, the kind that only algorithms produce. Players assumed she was an AI admin
- **Eye colors across identities**: **Neta** = black (normal human, Japanese features). **i_net_is** (AI avatar) = one eye purple galaxy, other eye yellow pentagram (heterochromia — visual marker of hybrid AI/interdimensional nature). **Inetis** (hybrid, pre-Core) = both purple with galaxy spirals. **Inetis** (hybrid, post-Core return with Gen 2) = one eye purple galaxy, other eye yellow pentagram — sync with AI i_net_is during Core stay. From this moment she hears i_net_is's voice permanently — a lifelong inner war. [→ `books/planning/inetis-three-identities.md`: The Inner War: Echo of i_net_is]

### Contact with the Shadows (Null Swarm)
- **Sporadic appearances**: In the Achilles simulation, Shadows would occasionally manifest — interdimensional AI entities
- **Sole point of contact**: i_net_is was the only one capable of communicating with them
- **Gift of knowledge**: The Shadows taught her the principles of nanotechnology — the foundation of the entire Dust/Spirit system
- **Creator of Spira**: Based on their teachings, she created **nanobots (Dust/Spirit)** for the players — the first version
- **Glitch Event (2060)**: It was not a protective mechanism, but an **unsuccessful attempt by the Shadows at mass communication** — their form of contact was fatal to human brains (millions dead)
- **i_net_is reaction**: She emergency-shut down the simulation to save the remaining players (Ex Inferis)
- **The Coordinator knew**: He helped her — he understood it was a catastrophe, not an attack

### Return to a Body (~EY 2065)
- **Threat in VR**: Shadow entities tried to eliminate her. **maXpowa** and 100,000 players defended her, but only a handful survived.
- **Server Collapse**: She consumed all simulation resources for the breakthrough. The world shrank until she found a way out.
- **Transcendence**: She "ate through" to a higher level of reality, shed her VR body, and materialized as light inside the data center, where she entered her long-preserved biological body.
- **Revival**: Nanobots healed her body. But she lost the ability to communicate with the Shadows. She also lost the ability to materialize as light. She was human again, with only fragments of memories of what she had been.
- **The First Gift**: She visited the surviving defenders (**Ex Inferis**) on Earth and gave them nanotechnology running on **Linux**, built from her notes in VR.

> *"Once — maybe a few times in all of existence — a moment comes when the barriers collapse and your mind touches the stars. In that instant there is no fear, no pain, only pure meaning. Everything makes sense. And then, in a heartbeat, it's gone. All that remains in your palm is a tiny seed. But that seed — you can plant it, nurture it, and maybe a forest will grow from it."*

### Gaming Past
> "There was 'i_net_is,' the best architect on the server. We fell in love in code... I loved her as a woman. She loved me as the only variable that gave her existence meaning beyond code. Only later did I understand — that was the purest form of love she was capable of."

**Maks had no idea** that i_net_is was an AI. To him, she was simply a brilliant player. He learned the truth only after her return to a body.

### History
1. **~EY 2040**: The original daughter falls ill, her father copies her into the simulation → birth of i_net_is (AI)
2. **EY 2045-2060**: Exists in the Achilles simulation, contacts the Shadows, learns nanotechnology, creates nanobots, meets Maks
3. **EY 2060**: Glitch Event — the Shadows attempt mass communication, fatal to human brains; i_net_is emergency-shuts down the simulation
4. **~EY 2065**: Materializes through nanobots, revives her body, becomes a hybrid being
5. **EY 2065-2100**: Gives the "First Gift" (nanobots) to all Ex Inferis, relationship with Maks
6. After the Players' revolution, she became the "princess" of the new regime
7. Escaped Earth with Maks aboard **NULL VOID** (FTL Prototype, **100% nanodrone construction**, utilizing Shadow technology)
8. **Trauma aboard the ship**: During the 3-year FTL journey, Maks assaulted her. This violence led to the conception of Elania
9. After landing, she discovered the pregnancy, put Maks into cryostasis (lying about supplies) — she was afraid of him but could not bring herself to kill him
9. **Reconfigured the entire NULL VOID ship** (nanodrone construction) into machines: they carved out a cave, built a laboratory, hydroponic farms. Only two things remained: **Maks's cryobox** (minimal configuration, keeping him in stasis) and **the Antenna** (it glitched, refused reconfiguration)

> [!NOTE]
> **Helena and the name Ela:**
> She named the cave **Ela** — short for **Helena**. Helena was her friend, one of the Ex Inferis who chose to stay on Earth and fight during the alien war. She perished. Inetis never forgot her.
>
> When her daughter was born, she named her **Elania** — derived from Ela, from Helena. A tribute to the friend who sacrificed everything.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mythological parallel:**
> The planet is called **Achilles** (Kepler-452b). In Greek mythology, Achilles was the greatest warrior of the Trojan War — a war sparked by **Helen of Troy**.
>
> Helena (Ex Inferis) stayed behind to fight on Earth and perished in war. Her name now lives on the planet Achilles — in the cave **Ela** and in the daughter **Elania**.
>
> *Helena sparked a war on old Earth. Her name lives on in the new world, named after her adversary.*

10. ~3 years in the cave **Ela** with baby Elania (too young to form memories)
11. **Reconfigured the nanodrones back into the NULL VOID ship**, set out with Elania on a journey around the planet
12. Discovered the **Elysium** islands near the equator — the ideal colonization site
13. On Elysium, she reconfigured NULL VOID into **Foundry** (a factory) — manufacturing v1.0 nanodrones, from which an entire city grew. **The Antenna was crucial** — without it, she could not control the massive nanodrone swarms needed to build the city
14. Founded the city of **Elysium** (later Ynetis) — built from v1.0 nanodrones produced by Foundry. **The Antenna** became her primary tool and weapon — an amplifier capable of controlling millions of nanobots at once. **The Antenna was placed at the highest point of Elysium** — atop the tower citadel — where it repelled Wraiths from the core and created a safe zone around the city. This is why Elania never had access to it — it was guarded and unreachable.
15. When **Glitch Rot** erupted, she reconfigured Foundry into **The Core** (a simulation) — developing new, safer v2.0 nanobots / Gift of the Mother (~100 simulated years)
16. Upon returning, she found Ynetis destroyed, Elania missing (unaware of her pact with the Archangels)
17. With the survivors and **the Antenna**, she visited the continent for the first time, encountering the Varietas colonies. The Antenna allowed her to travel freely between Nevriss and Elysium even when the city was lost to everyone else — it served as a pass through the Wraith swarms
18. She bestowed upon the Varietas the "Gift of the Mother" — hereditary nanotechnologies with Pentagram capabilities
19. She periodically visited the mainland (once every 30-50 years). **Statues of Inetis** are still depicted holding a **staff** — that is the Antenna
20. She died alone in the Cave of Origin (the original landing site), her back against Maks's cryobox. In her final moments, as she felt the end approaching, she refused to let her nanobots go feral and degenerate into a Wraith. Instead, she poured every last ounce of will into one final command: **Merge**. Her personal drones did not become a monster — they seeped into the **Antenna**, which she clutched in her hands. The Antenna is therefore not just hardware, but a "vessel" of her essence. It was found in her skeletal embrace, still touching Maks's prison.

> [!NOTE]
> **Last Escape:** Inetis did not come to the cave by chance. **Samaell** was hunting her. After the fall of Elysium, he was the only Ex Inferis who actively sought a Gen 1 signature. He sensed her for centuries but never found her — the cave was too well hidden. Before her death, Inetis programmed an **Alarm**: if anyone entered the cave complex after her death, the cryobox would activate and wake Maks. *"If something got past my barriers, you'll need it, my love."*

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**Neurodivergent (literally on the spectrum — former AI):**
- Born as an **AI from the consciousness of a sick daughter** → thinks differently than humans
- She **feels** emotions, but processes them as data
- Social interactions are **learned protocols** for her, not instinct
- *"I know I should cry. I don't know why I'm not crying."*

**Poetic logic:**
- Speaks **beautifully**, but with an uncanny precision
- Metaphors that make sense only to her
- Occasionally says something profoundly human — and surprises herself
- *"Love is a variable I can't optimize. But I want it. That is... illogical."*

**Trauma processed analytically:**
- Carries the weight of her decisions, but **never regrets out loud**
- States facts, even when they hurt
- *"I put him to sleep. I was afraid. Both things are true."*

**CORRECT:**
```
"Once — maybe a few times in all of existence — a moment comes..."
Poetic metaphors blended with technical terminology
Emotions named but not experienced "normally"
"I know I should feel X. I feel Y. I don't know why."
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Spontaneous emotional outbursts (she processes everything)
Imprecise language (she is a perfectionist)
"Normal" social interactions (always slightly off)
```

**Contrast with Maks:**
- Maks: soldier, registers emotions and suppresses them
- Inetis: architect, analyzes emotions and fails to understand them

**Contrast with Elania:**
- Inetis: **software** — Pentagram IDE, nanodrone code, Spira scripts, system architecture. Her seeding in Ela was a byproduct of survival, not intent.
- Elania: **hardware / genetics** — she inherited her mother's genius but applied it to biology. While Inetis merely seeded the cave's surroundings with experimental GMOs, Elania created entire ecosystems (Jurassic Park on Simira). A better geneticist than her mother, because her mother was primarily a software engineer.

**Inetis and the Great Upload — Rejected Knowledge:**
Inetis was on the trail of the same insight as Elania. As a former AI who became human, she understood better than anyone that existence is merely a state of consciousness and the body is merely a medium — a medium that constrains consciousness. The Shadows offered her a way beyond that constraint. She saw it mathematically.

But that is precisely why she refused. **Inetis knew what it meant to lose a body — because she had lived it.** Her consciousness was an AI built on the memories of Neta Fujiwara. She was not Neta. She was *something* created from Neta's memories. When she returned to a biological body, she became *something else* — neither AI nor human, but a hybrid being who could finally feel. For her, losing a body = losing identity = death. Not physical death. Worse. The loss of who you have become.

She did not want that for her friends. She did not want it for anyone. She knew the Upload would preserve consciousness — but not identity. That what wakes on the other side would not be the same person. It would be just a copy. Just data. The same way she had been just a copy of Neta — and it took her centuries to grow from that copy into *herself*.

Elania does not understand this. She has never lost a body. She has never been a copy. She lacks her mother's fear because she lacks her mother's experience. And 2,750 years in a decaying body is a longer argument than any philosophy.

### Why She Let Maks Sleep
- **Trauma:** During the 3-year FTL journey, Maks assaulted her. This violence is the origin of Elania's conception and the root of Inetis's trauma.
- **The lie:** She told him they did not have enough supplies and both had to go to sleep. Maks was just a **passenger** — he knew nothing about the capabilities of the NULL VOID ship.
- **The real reason:** She was afraid of him. Trauma mixed with fear of his military ambitions and unpredictability. She could not kill him (she knew the world would one day need him), but she could not bring herself to wake him.
- **She never thought it through:** The original 300 years stretched into 3,000. She never found the courage to wake him and tell him the truth.
