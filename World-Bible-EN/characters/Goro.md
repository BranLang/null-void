## Appearance

**Physical:**
- Enormous gorilla man, wider at the shoulders than a doorframe
- Gray fur on massive forearms
- Face calm, almost meditative
- Eyes dark, intelligent — too intelligent for an "animal"
- Doesn't sit on a throne, has no palace — just an **office in the laboratory** (tradition: *"Goro is not a king, Goro is a servant"*)

**Movements:**
- Slow, deliberate, weighted
- When Goro stands, the hall *trembles* — not from an earthquake, but from the sheer mass of his body
- A head taller than Rau (elite Paladin) — which says something

## Backstory

### Rise to Power
- **Apes tradition:** A leader becomes Caesar by defeating the previous one
- **Goro won** — not by brute force, but through a combination of strength and strategy
- **Young Caesar:** At 45 he is the youngest Caesar in the last 500 years
- **Respect:** Every Apes respects him — not out of fear, but out of reverence

### Origin of the Apes
- **ARK-11 colonists:** The Apes are descendants of genetically modified primates from ARK-11 (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans)
- **Separated from humans** after landing (AY 0) — left for the southern continent (Aprika)
- **3000 years of isolation:** Built their own civilization without contact with Terra
- **Three species:** Chimpanzees (majority of the population), gorillas (soldiers, scientists), orangutans (engineers, philosophers)

### Secret History (unknown to Terra)
- **Conflicts with Neuropa:** Wars between the Apes and humans took place in the past
- **Terra doesn't know** — this history is unknown to them
- **The Apes remember:** They have archives, records, historical analyses
- **Legends of the burning Earth:** They hacked ARK-11 communication systems and have *video footage* of Earth's fall captured through telescope

## Apes Civilization

### Military Technocracy
- **Philosophy:** Science + military strength = survival
- **Structure:** Every Apes is both a soldier and a scientist — there is no division
- **Hierarchy:** Based on competence, not heredity
- **No capitalism:** They don't hoard wealth — resources serve the collective

### Cultural Identity (dichotomy)
- **Gratitude:** Humans elevated them from apes to intelligent beings
- **Anger:** Those same humans caused Earth's fall and drove them into space
- **Independence:** Humans are not gods — they are a warning, not a role model
- **Propaganda:** Strong collective identity built on these pillars
- **Motto:** *"We are their children. But we are not their slaves."*

### Apex (capital city)
- **No palaces:** Functional architecture, not ostentation
- **Laboratories at the center:** Science is the heart of their society
- **Underground complexes:** Fusion power plants, particle accelerators, research
- **The Caesar has no residence:** Goro lives in the laboratory — leading by personal example

### Secret Preparations
- **On the surface:** They live quietly in the jungle, drawing no attention
- **Underground:** The real civilization — generations ahead of Terra
- **Goal:** Reach a technological level where *nobody* can defeat them
- **Dark Forest Theory:** They know the universe is dangerous — if they reveal themselves too early, they perish

### Relationship with Terra
- **An unimpressive rival:** Terra doesn't understand how nanotechnology works
- **They use it but don't comprehend it:** The Varietas use Spira as magic, not science
- **Goro wants the fundamentals:** Not just using it — *understanding* it
- **Distrust:** Humans destroyed Earth — why should they be trusted?

### Fleet
- **Could be built quickly** — they have the capacity
- **No point:** Without tech superiority, they'd be vulnerable
- **They wait:** When they're ready, they'll reveal themselves

## Personality

### Core
- **Extremely intelligent:** Scientist-warrior, not just a brutish leader
- **Ambitious:** Wants to leave a legacy — not just rule, but *change* the Apes
- **Just:** Believes in fairness, not tyranny
- **Humble:** Doesn't sit on a throne, rejects pomposity

### Curiosity
- **Seeks knowledge:** Not power for power's sake — power for *understanding*
- **Nanotechnology:** His primary interest — how to extend the lifespan of the Apes?
- **Respect from the west:** He wants humans to respect the Apes as equals

### Long-term Thinking
- **Generational perspective:** Thinks not in years, but in centuries
- **Legacy:** What will he leave behind? A stronger civilization? Understanding of the universe?
- **Patience:** Better to wait 100 years than to risk acting prematurely

## Speech and Thinking Style

**Young leader (but wise):**
- Speaks **slowly, with weight** — every word deliberate
- But it's not the weariness of old age — it's *discipline*
- Asks questions more often than he gives orders

**Scientist-warrior:**
- Combines military pragmatism with scientific curiosity
- *"Why does it work? Not just WHAT, but WHY."*
- Analyzes, but also knows when to act

**Humble leader:**
- Rejects titles, pomposity
- *"Goro is not a king. Goro is a servant."*
- Listens to advisors, isn't afraid to change his mind

**CORRECT:**
```
"Why?" (one word, but it weighs a ton)
"Explain it to me as a scientist, not as a soldier."
"What do we gain? What do we lose? What's the probability?"
Long, thoughtful pauses before answering
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Outbursts of anger (too disciplined)
Arrogance (he's humble)
Hasty decisions (always analyzes)
Pompous speeches (he rejects that)
```

**Contrast:**
- Grond: a soldier who does nothing but fight
- Goro: a soldier who *thinks about* why he fights

## Motivations

### Primary
1. **Nanotechnology:** Understand the fundamentals, not just use them
2. **Life extension:** So the Apes can compete with the long-lived elite
3. **Respect:** Not subordination — equal standing with humans
4. **Protection:** Prepare the Apes for any threat from the cosmos

### Secondary
- **Legacy:** To be remembered as the Caesar who *elevated* the Apes
- **Knowledge:** Curiosity — he wants to know how things work
- **Justice:** The Apes deserve better — not through war, but through science

## Relationships

### Rau & Kira (Paladins)
- **Rau (Crimson Vanguard):** Commander of the Crimson Guard. Wears heavy armor with a red crest and brass accents. Aggressive, loyal, Goro's "Fist."
- **Kira (Cobalt Guard):** Commander of the Cobalt Guard. Silver armor, blue crest. Defensive specialist, Goro's "Shield."
- **Mutual respect:** Goro doesn't micromanage them — he knows their capabilities. They are the best of the best.

### Zaya (Ishtar)
- **Communication:** Has a holographic link with her
- **Cautious cooperation:** They don't fully trust each other, but share common interests
- **Intel on Terra:** Zaya provides him with information about the continent

### Elania
- **Interest:** Knows little about her, but her technology intrigues him
- **Potential alliance?** Both want nanotechnology...
- **But:** Elania has Sera. That changes everything.

### Sera ("Tenshi no Shi" — Angel of Death)
- **Legend:** The fifth Archangel in the eyes of the Apes — worse than the other four
- **Why:** She's not Ex Inferis (no weaknesses), pure Gen 1 nanotech, 3200 years
- **Intel:** Goro has records. They've seen her fight. *Once was enough.*
- **Respect:** Goro does not underestimate her — she is the only being he truly fears
- **Calculation:** If the Paladins (Rau, Kira) met Sera... it wouldn't be them walking away
- **Elania is not a warrior.** Sera is. And that is the problem.

### Maks (unknown)
- **Intel:** Zaya reported an "Exorcist" in Shoraven
- **Concern:** An ancient human with Gen 1 nanotech? Interesting...

## Role in the Story

### Book 1 (Prach Nevriss)
- **In the background:** Sends the Paladins (Rau, Kira) to Shoraven
- **Goal:** Acquire the Antenna — an artifact that could unlock the secrets of nanotechnology
- **Intel:** Receives reports from Zaya about the situation on Terra

### Later Books
- **Potential ally?** Goro is not evil — he's a pragmatist
- **Or a rival?** If Maks stands in the way of his goals...
- **A complex character:** Not a black-and-white antagonist

## Notes for Writers

**Writing Goro:**
- He's not the typical "barbarian chieftain" — he's a *thinker*
- A combination of strength and intelligence — both equally important
- His humility is real, not a mask
- Long pauses before answers — he thinks

**Contrast with other leaders:**
- Grond: a paranoid tyrant who's lost his mind
- Mormiel: a manipulator hiding behind a facade
- Goro: open, intelligent, fair — but still *dangerous*

**Avoid:**
- Don't make him a "dumb ape" — he's a genius
- Don't make him a saint — he's a pragmatist, he'll make hard choices
- Don't make him a tyrant — they respect him, not fear him

## Apes Technology (Goro's Legacy)

### Known
- **Fusion power plants:** Underground, providing energy
- **Particle accelerators:** Fundamental physics research
- **Power Armor:** Elite armor for the Paladins
- **Vibro-axes:** Blades vibrating at a frequency that cuts through anything
- **Hard Light shields:** Energy shields (not Spira — a different technology)
- **Submarines:** The Silent Current and others — for covert operations

### Sought
- **Nanotechnology:** Fundamental understanding
- **Life extension:** So the Apes can compete with the Archangels
- **The Antenna:** Key to controlling large nanobot swarms

### Missing
- **Gen 1/2 nanobots:** No access to the original technology
- **Haiku script:** Don't know the programming language of nanobots
- **FTL drive:** They know it exists, but they don't have it
