## Appearance

**Physical:**
- Looks like a 20-year-old Japanese woman
- Tall (~180cm) — unnaturally so for an Asian woman (genetic enhancement)
- Black hair, long, tied back
- Asian features, but **flawless** — too symmetrical (uncanny valley effect)
- A face that's beautiful, but designed, not born
- Muscular but lean — every muscle exactly where it should be

**Eyes:**
- Dark, nearly black
- They look young, but deep within: **emptiness, exhaustion, millennia of sorrow**
- Anyone who looks into her eyes sees time — too much time

**Movements:**
- Too precise, too efficient
- Smooth as water
- Veteran + genetic enhancement = supernatural grace
- Every step calculated

**Voice:**
- A young female voice
- But the tone: **cold, old, guarded**
- Speaks slowly, deliberately
- Every word carries weight

## Backstory

### Origins (Earth — ARK-11)

**Birth & Early Life:**
- Born on Earth in Japan (EY ~2145)
- Parents: engineers selected for the ARK-11 program
- Genetically modified before birth (ARK enhancement protocol)
  - Increased height, muscle density, reflexes
  - Metabolism optimized for deep space travel
  - **Absolute perfection** — designed, not born

**ARK-11 Journey:**
- A small child when she departed with her parents on ARK-11 (likely ~5 years old, EY 2150)
- Journey to Kepler 452b (~454 years, combination of FTL and cryostasis)
- Awakened on the new planet (AY 0 = EY 2604)

### Father (Glitch Rot Tragedy)

**Name:** [TBD — Japanese name]
**Role:** ARK-11 engineer, weapons specialist
**Death:** AY ~500, Glitch Rot during the Great Crisis in Elysium

**Legacy:**
- **Yari** (Japanese spear) — brought from Earth, the last thing from Japan
- Taught Sera Haiku
- Trauma: Sera watched her father disintegrate from Glitch Rot

**Impact on Sera:**
- Elania taught her vampirism. So they could be together for eternity.
- She never wants to die of Glitch Rot like her father
- The Yari — a telescoping nanobot weapon that looks like a flute — is the last memento of her father, of Japan, of Earth

### Timeline

**AY 0-500 (Building Elysium):**
- Sera helps her parents build Elysium
- Witness to the birth of a civilization
- Lives a normal life until the crisis

**AY ~500 (Great Crisis — Glitch Rot Epidemic):**
- Gen 1 nanobots began to fail
- Thousands died, including Sera's father
- Sera serves as a no-name bodyguard protecting the core
- When Inetis reappears after years inside the simulation, she finds a handful of survivors in Elysium, among them Mormiel and Sera, and gives them her gift — Gen 2 nanobots

**AY 500 (Great Battle — Humans vs Varietas):**
- Sera **did not participate** (neutral stance)
- After the battle, when Inetis vanished
- Left with Elania to the **Tower of the Lost** (southern continent)
- When she couldn't protect the mother, she protected the daughter.

**AY 500-2013 (Elania's Bodyguard):**
- 1500+ years as Elania's blade
- Protects her, monitors the world on her behalf
- Knows every exorcist personally (they report to her upon returning from Terra)
- Practices vampirism — no Glitch Rot

---

## Personality

**Core Traits:**
- **Pragmatic** — 3200 years taught Sera that idealism kills
- **Cold** — emotions are a luxury she cannot afford
- **Cautious** — every step deliberate, no unnecessary risks
- **Weary** — she has seen too much, survived too much
- **Loyal** — her vow to Inetis holds to this day (protect Elania)
- **Without ambition** — she doesn't want to rule, doesn't want power — she only wants to serve someone interesting
- **Clear-headed** — she knows who she is, what she does, and why. No illusions about herself.
- **Tsundere** — on the surface she plays the ice goddess, "Angel of Death," untouchable. In private? She draws **ecchi art**. A sketchbook full of drawings that the Maki would pray over if they knew. Nobody knows — except Elania, who finds it hilarious. She plants one drawing of Tami ("Pirate Princess" — pen and ink on parchment) on a bulletin board in a Shoraven pub, among job postings and notices, the day before Links arrives. Links takes it. Point of no return.

**Similar to Mormiel:**
- Veteran of millennia
- Neutral in conflicts (didn't participate in the Great Battle)
- Observes, doesn't interfere unnecessarily
- But when she acts — **brutally efficient**

**Differences from Mormiel:**
- Sera has a purpose (protect Elania)
- Mormiel has only survival
- Sera still feels (wearily, but she feels)
- Mormiel is already nearly hollow

## Abilities & Powers

### Gen 1 + Gen 2 Nanobots

**Gen 1 (Earth origin):**
- The oldest, purest nanotech
- Absolute control over her own body
- Regeneration (not immortality, but close)
- Enhanced reflexes, strength, endurance
- **Sees across spectra** — infrared, UV, nanobot signatures

**Gen 2 (NULL VOID upgrade):**
- Haiku script compatibility
- Advanced combat protocols
- Spira detection & manipulation (limited)

**Vampirism (maintenance):**
- Practiced on Pursang livestock (bred at the Tower of the Lost)
- Drains nanobots from Pursang blood
- Keeps Gen 1+2 nanobots clean, free of Glitch Rot
- **Necessity**, not sadism
- **She feels guilt and remorse** — but if she wants to remain at Elania's side, she must sacrifice something
- **Contrast with Mormiel:** Mormiel *savors* vampirism — sees it as pleasure, superiority, enjoys the fear in her victims' eyes. Sera does it with disgust.

### Combat Skills

**Yari Mastery:**
- 3200 years of training with a Japanese spear
- **Yari** = nanotech telescopic spear
  - Inactive: a small flute-like device on her belt
  - Active: 2-metre spear with a nanotech blade
  - Blade = Gen 1 tech, never ages, never breaks

**Fighting Style:**
- Precise, efficient, no wasted movement
- Combines Japanese martial arts with 3200 years of experience
- **One strike, one kill**
- Never overestimates an opponent, never underestimates

**Tactical Mind:**
- Analyzes enemies instantly (nanobots scan)
- Sees weak points, energy signatures, heat patterns
- Plans 10 steps ahead
- **Knows when to fight and when to run**

---

## Motivations & Goals

**Primary Mission (AY 2013):**
- Bring the **Antenna** artifact back to Elania
- Investigate the "immortal exorcist" (Maks)
- Find out what happened to the Paladins (Rau & Kira)

**Hidden Agenda:**
- **Maks's profile = a mystery bigger than the artifact**
- Sera knows every exorcist personally
- Maks doesn't fit any profile
- **Who is he? Where did he come from? Why does Elania know about him?**

**Long-term Goal:**
- Protect Elania (vow to Inetis)
- Help Elania find "someone who shares her blood" (Maks = father?)
- Keep her Gen 1+2 nanobots functional (vampirism)
- **Perhaps find meaning in immortality**

---

## Relationships

### Elania (Partner/Friend)
**Dynamic:**
- Sera = bodyguard, but also a friend
- Has known Elania for 2500+ years
- The only person Elania trusts completely
- **Private nickname**: Sera calls Elania **"El"** — intimate, just between them
- Inetis's vow: *"Watch over my daughter."*
- Sera has been keeping that vow for 1500+ years

**Why Sera Serves Elania:**
- **Elania is creative** (like her mother Inetis) — mad scientist + leader
- **ADHD + depression** — emotional waves alternate with wild ideas and impulses
- **Unpredictable, incalculable** — after 2500 years, Sera STILL doesn't fully understand her
- **That's what Sera likes** — after 3000 years, most things are boring, predictable
- **Elania = the only thing that still surprises her**
- Sera has no ambition to rule — but she has an ambition to be beside someone INTERESTING

**Contrast:**
- **Elania** = chaos, creativity, ADHD genius, emotional, unpredictable
- **Sera** = order, pragmatism, cold professional, stable
- **Perfect balance:** Sera provides stability, Elania provides excitement

**Current Status:**
- Sera carries out Elania's orders without question
- But she has her own curiosity (Maks = mystery)
- She is Elania's equal (just as strong, better in most things)
- **But she WANTS to serve** — not out of subordination, but out of choice

### Renn (Deceased — Former Core Team Member)

**Dynamic:**
- Sera and Renn served together in **Inetis's Core Team** for 150+ years (~AY 700-850)
- Both humans from Earth, same generation from ARK-11 (Sera Japanese, Renn Icelandic)
- Renn was a civilian, quiet, dependable — Sera respected him even though he wasn't a soldier
- In certain circles, Renn was a legend — Sera knows exactly who he was
- **Unforgettable blue eyes** — Sera remembers them even after millennia

**Recognizing Tami:**
- When Sera meets Tami — she sees **blue eyes** and understands
- The same unforgettable eyes Renn had
- OSINT + blue eyes + "fox captain from the east" = **Renn's daughter**
- The Antenna scene gains enormous emotional weight — Sera isn't handing an artifact to a random pirate, but to the daughter of an old friend

### Inetis (Deceased — Former Friend)

**Dynamic:**
- Sera knew Inetis personally
- Defended her during Elania's departure (EY -10)
- **Inetis's last words:** "Take care of Elania. And if you find Maks... tell him the truth."
- Sera keeps that vow to this day

### Maks (Unknown — Target of Interest)

**Sera's Assumptions:**
- Immortal exorcist
- Powerful (survived an encounter with the Paladins)
- **Not on the exorcist registry** = a mystery
- Perhaps... Elania's father? (Elania is searching for him)

**Mission:**
- Find him
- Observe him
- Report to Elania
- **Perhaps... tell him the truth?**

### Maki (Worshippers)

**Why the Maki Worship Sera:**
- Felix (a Mako) knew Sera from ARK-11
- He told other Maki about "The Last Pure Human"
- Sera = the only **pure** human who saw Japan (Ex Inferis are also from Earth, but they are vampires)
- **A goddess from Earth, immortal, perfect**

**Sera's Reaction:**
- Ignores the worship
- Needs neither gods nor worshippers
- But respects the Maki (she knew their ancestors)

### Apes (Legend Status)

**"Fifth Archangel" / "Angel of Death":**
- Among the Apes, Sera is a **legend** — not Ex Inferis, but something worse
- The four Archangels (Samaell, Grond, Ishtar, Mormiel) = powerful, but comprehensible
- **Sera = a different category** — a pure human, Gen 1 nanotech, 3200 years of experience
- The Apes call her **"Tenshi no Shi"** (Angel of Death) — a Japanese name, out of respect for her origin

**Why they fear her:**
- **She's not Ex Inferis** — she has none of their weaknesses (Glitch Rot, need for sacrifices)
- **Elania is not a warrior** — but Sera? Sera is another league entirely
- **Paladins vs Sera:** If Rau and Kira met Sera in combat... it wouldn't be the Paladins walking away
- **Goro knows:** He has records on her. Respects her. Fears her.

**Apes Intel on Sera:**
- The last person to have seen Japan (a unique cultural legacy)
- Serves Elania (Inetis's daughter)
- Commands Haiku script perfectly
- They saw her fight once. *Once was enough.*

## Quotes

> *"I knew her mother. Inetis. I defended her so she could leave. I promised I would look after her daughter."*

> *"Because if I wanted to kill you or that man, you'd already be dead."*

> *"I can see nanobots in your blood. Old ones — Gen 3. Not very efficient, but still alive."*

> *"Ishtar no yarou... he sent them here. Without informing me."* (Japanese curse)

> *"Tell him he's not alone. That not everyone has forgotten. And that... someone is still looking for him. Someone who shares his blood."*

## Trivia

- **One of ~100 survivors from Earth** — Ex Inferis (4), human from Earth in the West (~100: teachers, doctors, "tourists"), Sera
- **The last person to have seen Japan** before Earth's destruction
- **Masters Haiku script** (native language of Inetis/Elania = Japanese)
- **The Yari = the last artifact from Japan** in the universe
- **The Maki worship her as a deity**
- **Practices vampirism** (not out of evil, out of necessity — maintains Gen 1+2 nanobots)
- **Genetically modified** — ARK program enhancement (height, strength, reflexes)
- **Uncanny valley effect** — looks too perfect, not natural
- **Secret artist** — draws ecchi art in private (tsundere gap moe). Elania knows and is amused. Plants a Tami drawing ("Pirate Princess") on a pub bulletin board in Shoraven — Links takes it, becomes his obsession. [→ links-notebook-first-contact.md]
- **Mirrors Helena** — Sera is to Elania what Helena was to Inetis: an artist, an emotional anchor, a female companion. Like mother, like daughter — both prefer female company and both chose an artist (Helena painted, Sera draws). And both lose her because of a father's decision.

## Story Role (Book 1: Prach Nevriss)

**Function:**
- **Catalyst** — brings information about Elania, the Paladins, the southern continent
- **Mystery** — Tami/Maks must ask: "Who is Elania? Why is she looking for Maks?"
- **Ally (tentative)** — not an enemy, but not fully trustworthy either
- **Prophecy bearer** — Sera speaks the prophecy "Three towers you shall pass" while looking at **Tami**, not Maks. The entire world (including the reader) assumes the prophecy is for Maks. It isn't.

**The Prophecy belongs to Tami:**
- Sera sees Renn's blue eyes in Tami — she knows Tami is Renn Ólafsson's daughter
- She gives the Artifact/Essence to Tami, not Maks — Tami is the carrier
- Maks is the means (getting the team to Shoraven). Tami is the target.
- **Three towers = Tami's arc:** The Glass Tower (Book 2-3), Tower of the Lost (Book 4), Ynetis/Core (Book 5)
- **"Truth belongs to El"** — Tami will bring the truth to Elania. Renn's daughter meets Inetis's daughter.

**Key Scenes (Book 1):**
1. **Encounter with Tami** — introduction, not a fight. Sera sees the blue eyes.
2. **Essence transfer** — Sera unlocks the Artifact and hands it to Tami (NOT Maks)
3. **Prophecy** — gaze fixed on Tami, not Maks. Tami feels it.
4. **Departure** — she vanishes. Maks frustrated. Tami confused — why was she looking at her?

## Speech and Thinking Style

**3200+ years of experience:**
- Every word is **filtered through millennia** — nothing superfluous
- Short sentences, 5-7 words maximum
- What she DOESN'T say is more important than what she says

**Three voices:**
1. **Deep voice** (business): cold, ancient, frightening
2. **Kawaii voice** (manipulation): fake cute, destabilizing
3. **Voice of truth** (prophecy): rare, resonant, terrifying

**CORRECT:**
```
"Kinetic swarm." (a statement)
"If we were fighting..." (unfinished)
"I knew her." (past tense = the weight of ages)
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
"That was amazing work with those nanobots!"
Long explanations and lectures
Technical info in the kawaii voice
```

**MANDATORY notes:**
Every line of Sera's dialogue MUST include a note:
```
"Artifact."
*[SERA — DEEP VOICE. One word. Testing the reaction.
Calculation: let them speak first.]*
```

## Notes for Writers

**Writing Sera:**
- Show don't tell — don't describe her as old, show it through the weariness in her eyes
- Uncanny valley — describe her as "too perfect," not merely beautiful
- Pragmatism — no unnecessary words, every sentence has a purpose
- Japanese heritage — occasional Japanese words (Yari, Haiku, curses)
- **Contrast:** Looks 20, but acts like a 3200-year-old veteran

**Avoid:**
- Don't make her a villain
- Don't make her a mary sue (she has limits — weary, alone, traumatized)
- Don't overdo the vampirism (it's maintenance, not a fetish)
- Don't overpowered her (she's strong, but not invincible)
