The most dangerous Archangel — she attacks the mind. Zaya (originally Ishtar) attempted to manipulate Max through an illusion of his daughter. Ultimately neutralized by Max and consumed by her own slaves.

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**3,000+ years (master of illusions):**
- Never speaks the truth directly
- Every sentence has a **double meaning**
- *"You see what you want to see. I'm just helping."*

**Seductive manipulator:**
- Soft, sweet voice
- Says what the victim wants to hear
- Never shouts — whispers

**CORRECT:**
```
"I can show you your daughter. Just for a moment."
Ambiguous offers, false promises
Kind tone with poison underneath
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Direct threats (she manipulates, never threatens)
Truth (always only illusions)
Anger (she would lose control)
```
