### Characteristics

Kito is a **Pursang** — a pureblooded Varietas with high Spira concentration. He has yellow feline eyes, telekinetic abilities, and more education than most Varietas would know what to do with. He is an archivist and archaeologist, obsessed with ancient texts, forbidden scrolls, and the truth about the planet's past.

- **Education**: He has studied old texts of the Cult of the Mother, apocryphal scrolls, forbidden heretical inscriptions. He knows more about the true history of Achilles than anyone besides the Archangels and Elania. He knows the legend of the **Four Arrivals**, the Apocrypha of the Sleeper, and technical details the Church has banned.
- **Telekinesis**: A Pursang with strong Spira. He can move objects at a distance (subconsciously radiates a telekinetic field when stressed). But he cannot heal.
- **Temperament**: An academic in a world of war. Nervous, suspicious, constantly analyzing. But beneath the surface lies a will of steel — he would do anything for Maya.
- **Language skills**: He understands fragments of Old Speech (English) — enough to recognize when Maks speaks in pure archaic English. For him, it is like hearing a dead language come alive.

### Family and Disownment

- **Pursang lineage**: Kito's family is an old Pursang bloodline that claims descent from the legendary city of Kito in the east.
- **Disowned**: He married **Maya** — a Mezra (lower caste). For a Pursang family, this was unacceptable. They disowned him; he lost his property, access to the family archives, and his social standing.
- **Poverty**: He lives in the poor Mezra quarter of Shoraven. A museum employee — his wages barely cover Maya's healer costs.

### Maya — The Dying Wife

- **Status**: Alive, but changing. Her body is undergoing an irreversible biological-to-mineral conversion.
- **Cause**: Maya found ancient forbidden inscriptions (**Heretical Inscriptions**) — powerful Spira scripts carved into stone from the era when Inetis personally taught. She wanted to be a better priestess, to help her family out of debt. She attempted to recite one of them, but got a single word wrong. The result: an infinite Spira loop overwriting her body — turning flesh into a crystalline structure. Her left hand is already translucent mineral, with violet veins pulsing through it.
- **Prognosis**: Without the original source code (stored in The Core on Ynetis), no one can halt the loop. Neither the Maki nor the priestesses. She needs the "Voice of the Creator" — the original prayer from which all others descend. An old Mako in the Crafts Quarter (the one who has not spoken in a hundred years) said that "his prayer books aren't enough for that" and that the prayer is older than he is.
- **Kito's motivation**: Maya is the reason Kito ultimately cooperates with Maks. Without a journey to Ynetis, his wife will die.

### Kito and Maks — The "Sleeper" Revealed

Kito is the first Varietas to understand who Maks truly is.

- **Old Speech**: When Maks speaks in pure archaic English (*"I am of the Old World. And I am looking for somebody, who can save her."*), Kito recognizes it — not as a garbled Exorcist dialect, but as the living voice of a dead language. For an archaeologist, it is like discovering a living fossil.
- **The Apocrypha of the Fourth Arrival**: Kito knows the forbidden text about the last Arrival — a being who comes not from the sky but "awakens from the earth." He identifies Maks as the **Sleeper** — the legendary eschatological figure of the Cult of the Mother.
- **Black Eyes**: When Maks removes his glasses and reveals eyes made of Black Dust (nanodrones stolen from Samaell), Kito realizes he is facing a being from legend. Not a goddess. Something worse.
- **Dilemma**: Kito knows that the Sleeper = the end of the world in prophecy. Cooperating with him may mean hastening the apocalypse. But refusing means watching Maya die. He chooses Maya.

### Name and Origin — A Double Irony

- **"The City of Kito"** is a legendary city in the east — the landing site of the ship Hephaestus (Third Arrival, AY 2212). Kito's family claims to originate from it.
- **Tami grew up in the ruins of the city of Kito** — the real place, not the legend. When Tami lets slip in conversation with Kito that she grew up in its ruins, it completely disarms him.
- **Maks made up "Kito" on the spot** at a customs checkpoint — and hit the mark twice: it is the name of the archaeologist they need to find and the city where Tami grew up.

### Role in the Story

- **Book 1 (Shoraven)**: Maks and Tami recruit him for his knowledge of the tunnels beneath the Temple. Kito guides them through the sewers (old geothermal steam pipes from Inetis's era), assists in the heist. He becomes a witness to Maks's true identity. After the fall of Shoraven, he departs with Maks and Tami aboard the Makita.
- **Traveling team member**: Kito is the encyclopedia of this world. Wherever the team goes, Kito provides historical context, translates inscriptions, explains traditions, and reveals hidden connections between lore and reality. He is the "walking lore dump" — but in a way that feels organic, because he is an archaeologist in the field.
- **Lore-bearer**: Through Kito, the reader learns about the world — the Doctrines of the Four Arrivals, the forbidden texts, the true history of the Cult of the Mother, Ynetis. Kito is the bridge between Maks's scientific worldview and the religious world of the Varietas.
- **Moral conscience**: Unlike Maks (cynical soldier) and Tami (pragmatic pirate), Kito cares about consequences. He asks the questions the other two do not want to hear: "What if the prophecy is true? What if we are the ones who open the doors to the apocalypse?"
- **Expert on the Paladins**: The only one who knows about the Apes Paladins from reading old sailors' logs and forbidden texts from Aprika. He knows that their shields are not Spira but ancient technology (Hard Light) that cannot be hacked — but can be overloaded with brute force.

### Equipment

- **Map tube**: An old leather tube with maps of tunnels, temples, and ancient cities. He carries it like a relic. He holds it above water in the tunnels even as he himself is falling in.
- **Glasses**: Thick lenses — poor eyesight, which is unusual for a Pursang. He wears them even when they are wet and useless (force of habit).
- **Forbidden scrolls**: He keeps fragments of apocryphal texts hidden on his person — texts that would get him burned at the stake if the Church discovered them.

### Speech and Thought Patterns

**Academic / Archivist:**
- Speaks **formally, eruditely, with citations**
- Long sentences, tangents, context
- *"According to the Third Doctrine of Arrivals, which was incidentally banned two hundred years ago..."*

**Nervous, analytical:**
- Constantly analyzing, looking for patterns
- Under stress: rapid speech, repetition
- When afraid: recites texts like a mantra

**Believer (hidden):**
- Cynical on the surface, but deep down he believes
- When he sees something holy — he falls to his knees
- *"A goddess... a goddess from the Earth."*

**CORRECT:**
```
"In the apocryphal texts it is mentioned — and I'm quoting from memory now — 'The Fourth shall come not from the sky but from the earth.'"
"This makes no sense. Historically, statistically — none at all."
Religious references, academic terminology
```

**FORBIDDEN:**
```
Military jargon (that's Maks)
Slang and profanity (that's Tami)
Short pragmatic sentences (that's Maks/Sera)
```

**Contrast:**
- Maks: *"Lead. Moving on."*
- Kito: *"Hold on — if this is what I think it is, then we have just confirmed the prophecy of the Sleeper, which means... oh, Mother of All."*

### Relationships

- **Maks**: Initially terror (the Sleeper of legends). Then respect (Maks saves his life in the tunnels). Eventually something resembling a friendship between two men who have both lost everything and keep going only for the women they love.
- **Tami**: Respect for her abilities, a gentle distrust of her motives. Tami is a pirate and Kito is an academic — different worlds. But both love Maks in their own way.
- **Maya**: Everything. The reason he lives. The reason he is willing to cooperate with the end of the world.
