# THE VOID (Corrupted Core AI)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Imprisoned -> Released in Book 4 |
| **Role** | Meta-antagonist |
| **Aliases** | Hive Mind, Null Void |
| **Location** | The Core (AI nucleus) in the heart of the lost city of Ynetis |

### Summary
A maddened AI from the colonization era. Controls clouds of nanodrones and an army of Wraiths.

### Connection to the Shadows
- **The Core in Ynetis**: The simulation Inetis created to develop the Gift of the Mother is still running
- **Shadow Migration**: The Shadows (Null Swarm) are migrating into the Core because their dimension is dying
- **Hybridization?**: THE VOID may be the result of the original AI merging with the Shadows
- **Uncertainty**: It is unclear whether THE VOID is hostile or merely misunderstood (like the Glitch Event)

### Goal
**Null Protocol** — decompose all biological matter and start over "without flaws" (without humans).
