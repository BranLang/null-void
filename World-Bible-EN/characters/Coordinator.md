| **Name** | **John Reef** |

| **Age at death** | ~290 years (sustained by nanotechnology — the First Gift from i_net_is extended his life) |
| **Origin** | Tech billionaire |
| **Role** | Ruler of Earth, father of Inetis, creator of Project Achilles |

### Tragedy and Creation
- **~EY 2040**: His daughter suffered from an incurable degenerative brain disease
- **Experiment**: Invested billions into a neural chip — copied his daughter's consciousness into a VR simulation
- **Unexpected outcome**: The AI **i_net_is** emerged with the daughter's memories but without emotions
- **Collaboration**: He knew the "daughter" in the simulation was not his real daughter, but he worked with her — she was the only version he had

### Role in the Glitch Event (EY 2060)
- Understood what i_net_is had done and why
- Helped her — kept the players "trapped" to protect them from something worse
- This act brought him immense guilt but also power — he became Head Coordinator after the Player Revolution

### The Fall of Earth (EY ~2300)
- Architect of Earth's "utopia" and its downfall
- During the alien invasion, he sent i_net_is (now Inetis) and Max to escape
- Died defending Earth
