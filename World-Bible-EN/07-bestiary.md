# Bestiary (Fauna and Flora)

Animals on Achilles are a combination of:
1. Genetically modified Earth species (imported by colonists).
2. Original Earth species that mutated under radiation and nanodrone influence.
3. (Possibly) Native planetary fauna (if any survived terraforming — TODO).

## Intelligent Beings and Animals

Thanks to genetic modifications and nanodrones, two main categories of intelligent life exist beyond "Pure" humans:

1. **Homo Sapiens Varietas (Varietas):** Hybrids with a human base and animal traits. They are fully-fledged social beings (see [Society](06-society.md)).
2. **Uplifted Animals (Intelligent Animals):** Animals with human-level intelligence that retained their animal anatomy.

### Uplifted Animals (Intelligent Animals)
- **Appearance:** Significantly larger than Earth dogs (size of a small horse). Thick fur, adapted to winter.
- **Role:** Horse replacements. Used for transport, sled-pulling, and hunting.
- **Intelligence:** Fully conscious, loyal, speak human language (rougher, simpler speech).
- **Range:** Everywhere humans are (except the southern jungle).

### Felis Sapiens (Great Cats)
- **Appearance:** Similar to cougars or lynxes, but larger.
- **Role:** Hunters, couriers, companions in warmer regions (South, Equatorial belt).
- **Intelligence:** Cunning, philosophical, speak fluently and often sarcastically.
- **Relationship to humans:** Less submissive than dogs, more like "business partners."

### Ice Bears (Ursus Titanus)
- **Appearance:** Gigantic white monstrosities scarred from battles.
- **Temperament:** Despise humans and civilization.
- **Status:** Solitary philosophers of the wasteland.
- **Speech:** Deep, slow, archaic.
- **Threat level:** Extreme.

## Domestic Animals (Livestock)
- **Cows, Chickens:** Exist and are raised for meat and eggs. Modified for higher gravity (shorter legs, more robust skeletons).

---

## Wild Beasts

### Birds
- Flight is difficult in 2x gravity, but the denser atmosphere helps (greater lift).
- Birds have larger wingspans and powerful musculature.
- They glide more often than they flap.

### Jungle Predators (Equatorial Belt)
- Fast, venomous, camouflaged.
- Mutated versions of reptiles and insects (or their analogs).

## Nanodrone Monsters

### Wraiths — An Evolutionary Cycle
- Not biological. Not a disease either. They are **v1.0 nanobots that chose to survive**.
- When Glitch Rot begins decomposing the host, nanobots detach — **self-preservation instinct**. They take a fragment of the host's consciousness as an OS and become autonomous swarms.
- They mimic shapes they "remember" (humans, wolves — the host's last consciousness).
- Attracted to active electronics (seeking energy to maintain coherence).
- Varietas consider them demons. In reality, they are nanobots from their own ancestors.

### Hollows
- Reanimated animal or human skeletons (techno-necromancy).
- **Summary**: Colonist skeletons/remains powered by nanodrones ("the dust").

## Additional Species (Lore)

### Bears (Gen-Mod)
- **ID**: `species.genmod_bear`
- **Summary**: Riding animals; larger and more intelligent than natural bears. Used for transport in rough terrain.

## Remnants of the Era of the Players (Tragic Experiments)

### "Doge" (Sub-sapiens)
- **Origin**: Genetically modified humanoid dogs created for billionaire entertainment in the 21st century.
- **Characteristics**: Limited intelligence (IQ 80-90) and often exhibit autistic traits. Their bodies are dysfunctional and painful (poor skeletal structure).
- **Status**: Often on the margins of Varietas society, viewed as "rejects" of the past.

### Super-Primates (Gorillas and Chimpanzees)
- **Origin**: Result of experiments to raise animal intelligence (IQ 140+).
- **Status**: Nearly extinct or living in extreme isolation in ruins. They are aware of their history and often cynical toward humans.
