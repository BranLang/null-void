---

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Official Name** | Neo Europa -> **Neuropa** |

| **Dominant Race** | Humans (Homo Sapiens Sapiens) |
| **Ruler** | **Elania** (de facto), local governments (de jure) |
| **Aesthetic** | **Solarpunk** — clean energy, glass, greenery, silence |
| **Technology** | 21st-century level (Solar, Wind, Lithography) + Relics |

## Deep Lore: The Clean Stagnation (Solarpunk)

### 1. Aesthetic and Atmosphere
Neuropa is not dirty and loud like Nevriss (dieselpunk/steampunk), nor brutal like Apex. It is **quiet and clean**.
- **Energy**: Wind turbines and solar farms are everywhere. Humans mastered renewable energy. Cities are full of greenery, vertical gardens, and white stone.
- **Low Density**: There are few people (Varietas number in the hundreds of millions, Apes in the tens of millions, Humans only in the millions). Cities are airy, spacious, almost empty.
- **Quality of Life**: High. No smog, no hunger.

### 2. Technology: 21st Century + God-Tech
They are not mere artifact collectors. They have a functioning industry, but a "clean" one.
- **Manufacturing**: They have chip fabrication plants (old but functional lithography), produce simple computers (terminals), LED lighting, electric vehicles.
- **God-Tier Artifacts**: What they CANNOT manufacture are Gen 1 nanotech weapons and medicines. These items are relics. But everyday life runs at roughly our 21st-century level.
- **Contrast**:
    - **Nevriss**: Steam, oil, noise, overcrowding.
    - **Neuropa**: Silence, electricity, cleanliness, emptiness.

### 3. Population and Hierarchy (Resource Efficiency)
- **Varietas (Terra)**: Most numerous (~200 Million). Breed quickly, die young.
- **Apes (Simira)**: Medium population (~50 Million). Maintain a perfect ratio between population and resources. No slums, no hunger.
- **Humans (Neuropa)**: Elite minority (~5 Million). Population is strictly controlled (1 child per couple) to preserve the "Solarpunk" utopia without exhausting resources.

### 4. History: Sera, the Angel of Death
Why haven't the Apes attacked Neuropa when they have industrial and numerical superiority?
- **Fear of the "Demons."**
- Apes technology (Hard Light) is resistant to conventional weapons but vulnerable to **Gen 1 Nanotech weapons** (like Yari), which can penetrate it.
- **Battle of the Silent Valley**: A thousand years ago, Sera stopped an Apes invasion not with an army but with a **nanotechnological plague** (localized Glitch Rot).
- Ever since, the Apes call Sera **"The White Death."** The cold war persists because the Apes believe Humans possess weapons of mass destruction.

## Cities and Regions

### 1. Ludus — Capital City of the Humans

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Center of the continent — river valley, hidden in greenery |
| **Population** | ~500,000 |
| **Character** | **Brutalist Solarpunk** — concrete, glass, and massive vegetation |

**Architecture and Housing:**
- **City in the Forest**: Ludus has no walls or suburbs. It is a cluster of tall, white and gray brutalist towers completely overgrown with vertical gardens. From a distance, the city is nearly invisible — it blends with the jungle.
- **3D-Printed Homes**: Most people do not live in the towers but in small family communities ("Clusters") in the surrounding area. Houses are 3D-printed from biopolymers and concrete — organic shapes reminiscent of hobbit holes or modern earth shelters. Roofs are either lawns or solar panels.
- **Communities**: No housing estates. People live in family clans (10-50 individuals), sharing gardens and workshops.

**Infrastructure (Invisible):**
- **No Roads**: Neuropa has no highways or paved roads. The surface belongs to nature.
- **Hyper-Tube**: Transportation runs through **underground vacuum tunnels** excavated by old nanotechnology. Capsules (Pods) connect communities with the city center at speeds of 600 km/h. On the surface, there is silence.
- **Footpaths**: Between homes, there are only narrow walkways for pedestrians and electric bicycles/scooters.

**Atmosphere:**
- **The Empty Continent**: Outside Ludus and a few enclaves, the continent is empty. Nature has reclaimed everything. Ruins of old cities are swallowed by forest. It is a world of silence, birdsong, and wind. No engine noise.
- **Aesthetic**: A combination of raw concrete (Brutalism) and lush greenery (Solarpunk). It evokes an abandoned yet maintained utopian city.

### 2. The Observatory — Enclave of the Exorcists

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | High mountains in the west (nearly unreachable) |
| **Population** | ~2,000 (students + masters) |
| **Character** | Monastery, academic institution |

**Description:**
- Ancient monastery — partially carved into rock
- Illuminated by bioluminescent fungi (no electricity)
- Cold, quiet, meditative
- Access only via narrow mountain passes — or by airship

**Education:**
- **Admission:** Primarily at age 10-14. Links was admitted as a 13-year-old prodigy.
- **Duration:** 7-10 years of study
- **Subjects:**
  - Wraithology (history, behavior, weaknesses of Wraiths)
  - Linux (programming language for nanobots)
  - History of Earth (Archangels, Ex Inferis, fall of civilization)
  - Haiku syntax (Gen 2 programming)
  - Martial arts (for those going into the field)
  - Philosophy of technology

**Daily Life of a Student:**
- 4:00 — Wake-up (gongs)
- 5:00 — Morning meditation in the cold hall
- 6:00-12:00 — Lectures and practical training
- 12:00 — Lunch (simple fare — rice, vegetables)
- 13:00-18:00 — Independent study, laboratories
- 18:00 — Dinner
- 19:00-21:00 — Free time (library, debates)
- 21:00 — Lights out

**Links at the Observatory:**
- Admitted as a 13-year-old — child prodigy
- Not a fighter — specialized in theory
- At age 20, defended his thesis: *"What If the Gods Left Source Code?"*
- After his defense, stayed on as a teaching assistant — but was not happy
- Spent two years drifting, climbing mountains, watching stars
- At age 22, decided to leave

### 3. Tower of the Damned — Elania's Domain

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Island to the west (separated from the mainland) |
| **Population** | ~50,000 |
| **Character** | Dark, nostalgic, technologically stagnant |

**Inhabitants:**
- Humans who survived the Glitch Rot — **reduced nanotech to a minimum**
- Use nanobots only to extend their lives — nothing more
- Living in the shadow of the past — technologically capable but lacking the will to change anything

**Elania:**
- Lives here in isolation
- Sera is her only link to the outside world
- Plans the Great Upload — but waits for now

### 4. Southern Wasteland — "Jurassic Park"

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | South of the continent (separated by an energy fence) |
| **Population** | 0 (permanent), transient (Ancient tourists) |
| **Character** | **Bio-hazard / Amusement park for Immortals** |

**Description:**
- **Experiment:** Elania's wildest genetic experiments. Out of control. Dinosaur-like beasts, chimeras, mega-fauna.
- **Death Zone:** Entry is forbidden (and lethal) for mortals.
- **Safari:** The Ancients (Immortals) come here for "hunts" in flying vehicles. It is their version of extreme sports. For the aristocracy of Ludus, it is an **"Amusement Park."**

---

### 5. Northern Pine Forests — The Bear Nations

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Northern quarter of the continent |
| **Population** | Unknown (dozens of tribes) |
| **Inhabitants** | **Bear Varietas (Bear Nations)** |

**Description:**
- **Territory:** Endless, dark, ancient pine forests.
- **Culture:** Tribal society, shamanism, totems. They respect strength. Territorial but not aggressive if left alone.
- **Relationship with Humans:** Cold peace. They trade (furs, medicinal herbs for metal), but do not allow humans into the forest.

---

### 6. Frozen Islands (The Frozen Bridge)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Location** | Sea between northern Neuropa and Terra |
| **Character** | Seasonal ice bridge |
| **Inhabitants** | **Talking Wolf Packs** |

**Phenomenon:**
- In winter, the sea between the islands freezes over, creating a walkable bridge to Terra. It is the only (dangerous) route for those without ships.

**Wolf Packs:**
- The islands are inhabited by **Intelligent Giant Wolves**.
- **Intelligence:** They speak. They think like humans (brain capacity genetically enhanced).
- **Hierarchy:** They have their own laws. They are not animals — they are "Guardians."
- **Travelers:** They allow passage across the ice only to those who pay a toll (meat, information) or show respect. For fools, they are death.

## Language and Communication

### Major Languages

| Language | Speakers | Character |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Old English** | The Ancients (immortals) | Archaic, slow, formal |
| **Ludus Slang** | Mortals in Ludus | Faster, abbreviated forms |
| **Mountain Dialect** | Exorcists, mountain communities | Terse, technical, full of Linux terms |
| **Bear Tongue** | Bear Varietas | Deep guttural sounds, gestures |

**Examples of Difference:**

| Old English | Ludus Slang | Mountain Dialect |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| "I understand your concern." | "Yeh, get it." | "Affirmative. Parsing." |
| "Where might I find...?" | "Where's da...?" | "Query: location of..." |
| "This is unacceptable." | "Nah, that's rot." | "Error. Reset required." |

## Politics and Relations

### Factions in Neuropa

```
+-------------------------------------------------+
|                   ELANIA                         |
|         (Shadow ruler, island)                   |
+------------------------+------------------------+
                         | (theoretical authority)
        +----------------+----------------+
        v                v                v
+------------+  +--------------+  +----------------+
|   LUDUS    |  | OBSERVATORY  |  | BEAR FORESTS   |
|   (City)   |  |  (Monastery) |  |   (Tribes)     |
+------------+  +--------------+  +----------------+
 Self-governing   Independent      Territorial
  aristocracy     institution       tribes
```

**Relations:**
- **Ludus <-> Elania:** Formal loyalty, but practical independence
- **Ludus <-> Observatory:** Respect. Ludus funds the Observatory, the Observatory supplies Exorcists.
- **Ludus <-> Bears:** Tension. Trade disputes over territory.
- **Observatory <-> everyone:** Neutral. Accepts students from all factions.

### Relationship with Terra

**NONE.**

Neuropa maintains a **2,500-year embargo** against Terra:
- The Ancients never returned after the Great War
- They regard Varietas as "modified animals"
- Trade is forbidden — smugglers risk the death penalty

**Exception:** Individual travelers (like Links) may travel — but they are considered eccentric.

---

## Daily Life

### In Ludus (City)

**Morning:**
- The Ancients rise late (eternity = no rush)
- Mortals work from dawn

**Work:**
- Blacksmithing, carpentry, construction (no Spira — pure craftsmanship)
- Agriculture in the surrounding areas
- Trade with the mountains

**Evening:**
- The Ancients visit salons — debating the past
- Mortals fill the taverns — drinking, singing
- Entertainment: live music, theater, chess

**Religion:**
- Weak. The Ancients know the truth about technology.
- Mortals have their own superstitions — a mix of old Earth traditions

### At the Observatory

**Atmosphere:**
- Quiet, academic, almost monastic
- No worldly distractions
- Students wear simple gray robes

**Hierarchy:**
- **Masters:** Veteran Exorcists, scholars
- **Students:** Young adepts (ages 10-25)
- **Servants:** Locals from mountain villages

## Links in the Context of Neuropa

### His Origin

| | |
|---|---|
| **Birth** | Ludus (~AY 2991) |
| **Family** | Mortals (middle class) |
| **Education** | Observatory (ages 13-20) |
| **Current Age** | 22 years |

### Why He Left

1. **Depression:** After his defense, he did not know what came next
2. **Boredom:** The Observatory was too academic, too isolated
3. **Longing:** He wanted to see the world — not just read about it
4. **Sera:** Her visit and gifts gave him direction

### What He Knows About the World

- Knows about Terra (from books) — but has never been there
- Knows about Varietas — but has never met one
- Knows about Wraiths — but has never fought one
- He is a **theorist** stepping into the real world

---

## Conclusion

Neuropa is a world of **stagnation and nostalgia**. People here live long — too long. They remember Earth but lack the courage to go back. They isolated themselves from Varietas yet are losing their reason to exist.

Links is a product of this world: educated but naive. He knows a lot but has experienced little.

His journey to Terra will be a culture shock — and that is exactly what the story needs.

## Deep Lore: The Stagnation Paradox (Update)

### 1. Agriculture: Legacy of the Golden Age
Neuropa does not use industrial fertilizers or mass mechanization like the Apes. They rely on **"Gaia's Legacy"** — technologies they inherited but do not understand.
- **Golden Grain (Gaia's Wheat)**: Genetically modified wheat from the days of Earth. Grows 4 times a year, is immune to pests, and requires no fertilization. Thanks to it, Ludus has enormous food surpluses with minimal effort.
- **Agro-Golems**: Old, autonomous machines work the fields (resembling walking silos). They are "black box" technology — no one knows how to build them, only how to maintain them. The Engineers' Guild guards them as sacred relics.

### 2. Technology: Relics vs. Innovation
This is the key difference between Humans and Apes.
- **Humans (Stagnation)**: They possess "God-Tier" technologies (nanotech medicines, old energy weapons) but **cannot manufacture them**. They are museum curators. Each year they have fewer functional pieces. They rely on quality that is slowly degrading.
- **Apes (Industrial Powerhouse)**: Started from zero, but over 3,000 years built their own high-tech civilization. They have **Maglev trains**, **Hard Light shields**, and **Vibro-weapons**. Their technology is not based on Spira (nanotech) but on pure physics and engineering.
- **Result**: Humans have superior *peak* weapons (one Human Exorcist with a Gen 1 weapon can destroy a tank), but the Apes have **logistics and mass production**. The Apes can produce a thousand vibro-axes in a month. Humans cannot produce a single laser rifle in a century.

### 3. History: Sera, the Angel of Death, and 500 Years of Peace
Why haven't the Apes attacked Neuropa when they have industrial superiority?
- **Fear of the "Demons."**
- Apes technology (Hard Light) is resistant to conventional weapons but vulnerable to **Gen 1 Nanotech weapons** (like Yari), which can penetrate it ("hack" the shield at a molecular level).
- **Battle of the Silent Valley**: A thousand years ago, Sera stopped an Apes invasion not with an army but with a **nanotechnological plague** (localized Glitch Rot).
- **500 Years of Peace**: Since then, there has been no war in Neuropa.
    - **Mortals**: They do not remember war. For them, "peace" is the natural state of the universe. They are naive and soft.
    - **The Ancients**: They remember the bloody wars. They maintain the "Cold War" and peace only through fear (Sera = The White Death).
- Ever since, the Apes call Sera **"The White Death."** The cold war persists because the Apes believe Humans possess weapons of mass destruction (which is true — Sera and Elania), while Humans fear that the Apes will one day overrun them through sheer numbers and steel.
