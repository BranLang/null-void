# Aprika — The Silent Continent

> *"We are their children. But we are not their slaves."* — Goro, Caesar of the Apes

---

## Overview
**Aprika** (the Southern Continent) is home to the **Apes** civilization — intelligent primates descended from genetically modified animals aboard the colonization ship ARK-11. To the rest of the world (Terra), it is a wild jungle inhabited by "animals." In truth, it is a **military technocracy** hiding in plain sight.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Population** | Homo Simia (Apes) — Chimpanzees, Gorillas, Orangutans |
| **Government** | Military Technocracy (ruled by the "Caesar" and the Council of Scientists) |
| **Capital** | **Apex** (hidden underground) |
| **Technology** | Advanced (Fusion, Hard Light, Vibro-tech), but lacking Nanotech (Spira) |
| **Politics** | Isolationism / "Dark Forest" doctrine |

## Society and Culture

### The Double Life
Apes civilization operates on a principle of **absolute secrecy**:
1.  **Surface (The Mask):** Primitive jungle settlements, hunters with spears.
2.  **Underground (The Truth):** Vast, sterile laboratories, fusion reactors, and cities carved into the planet's crust.

### Castes (Biological)
Society is not divided by class but by biology (based on capability):
-   **Chimpanzees (Citizens/Infantry):** 80% of the population. Versatile, aggressive, adaptable.
-   **Gorillas (Paladins/Scientists):** The physical elite and intellectual vanguard. Protectors and leaders.
-   **Orangutans (Engineers/Elders):** Patient builders, archivists of history.

## Military Strength: The Paladins

An elite caste of warriors who combine the brute strength of Gorillas with the most advanced available technology. Their appearance is deliberately **archaic** (resembling medieval knights), but the materials are futuristic.

### Visuals and Equipment
Based on visual records (see *Battle of the Gate*):

*   **Armor (The Shell):**
    *   **Design:** Massive plate armor (Full Plate) covering the entire body. Evokes European medieval style but adapted for gorilla anatomy (broader shoulders, longer arms).
    *   **Material:** Composite titanium-ceramic alloys. Gleaming silver-steel surface.
    *   **Helmet:** "Great Helm" with a narrow visor (HUD inside).
*   **Shield (Hard Light):**
    *   Apes do not use physical shields. A **circular energy shield** (blue or yellow energy) projects from the left forearm (or axe handle).
    *   Capable of deflecting projectiles and plasma.
*   **Weapons:**
    *   **Vibro-Halberd:** A long, heavy polearm with a vibro-blade. Can cut through stone and tank armor alike.
    *   **Power Axe:** One-handed variant for close combat.

### Color Coding (Ranks)
Paladins are distinguished by the color of their plume and armor detailing:

1.  **Cobalt Guard (Blue):**
    *   **Visuals:** Blue plume, silver armor with blue tabards.
    *   **Role:** **Defenders.** Guardians of gates, laboratories, and key individuals. Specialize in defensive formation ("Phalanx") with overlapping shields.


2.  **Crimson Vanguard (Red):**
    *   **Visuals:** Red plume, armor with brass/copper accents, red tabards.
    *   **Role:** **Assault.** Elite strike units. More aggressive, wielding heavier axes. Often accompany the Caesar into the field.
    *   *Example:* Rau (Goro's lieutenant).

## Technology Tree

The Apes evolved separately from Terra, which is why their technologies are entirely different:

| Category | Apes (Aprika) | Terra (Nevriss/Graw) |
|---|---|---|
| **Energy** | **Fusion** (clean, unlimited) | Combustion engines (Diesel) / Steam |
| **Materials** | Advanced metallurgy, composites | Steel, recycled scrap |
| **Nanotech** | **None** (they do not understand Spira) | Ubiquitous "Spira" (though perceived as magical) |
| **Weapons** | Vibro-tech, Hard Light, Railguns | Gunpowder, Elemental Spira |
| **Transport** | Underground maglevs, submarines | Airships, trains, horses |

### Civilization's Goal
Caesar Goro drives his people toward a single objective: **Gain control over Nanotechnology (Spira).**
They believe that "Spira" is not magic but lost science (which is true). Without it, they are defenseless against the Archangels (and potentially Sera), despite their power armor. That is why they wanted the Antenna.
