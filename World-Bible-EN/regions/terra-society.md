# Terra: Society and Culture

## Overview

Terra is the "Main Continent" — the beating heart of Varietas civilization. It is where 80% of the world's population lives. It is a world of chaos, life, war, and faith.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| **Population** | ~250 Million (predominantly Varietas) |
| **Dominant Race** | **Homo Sapiens Varietas** (Humans with animal traits) |
| **Aesthetic** | **Steampunk / Dieselpunk Fantasy** |
| **Technology** | **Spira** (Nanotech) perceived as Magic + Diesel machinery |
| **Politics** | **Eternal War** (North vs. South) + 20 Fragmented Kingdoms |

## World Scale (Super-Earth) and Infrastructure

Achilles is a planet of enormous dimensions. This fundamentally shapes Varietas society:

*   **No Roads:** Cities are separated by thousands of kilometers of dangerous wilderness. Varietas do not build roads or railways (except locally in Graw). Maintenance would be impossible.
*   **Air and Water:** The only effective transportation is by **Airships (Zeppelins/Yachts)** or massive naval convoys.
*   **Isolation:** Wars are logistically extremely demanding and therefore rare. Borders are not lines on the ground but zones of airspace influence.

## Geopolitics: A Divided World

The continent is split into three main spheres of influence:

### 1. Nevriss (South) — Land of the Mother
**"Freedom, Trade, Faith."**

*   **Ideology:** Theocracy mixed with cutthroat capitalism. They worship the **Mother (Inetis)** as the goddess of life.
*   **Government:** **Council of Guildmasters** (economy) + **Church of the Mother** (morality/law). The "Golden Rule" reigns here: whoever has the gold makes the rules.
*   **Aesthetic:** Colorful marketplaces, narrow alleys lit by neon (bioluminescence), temples of white marble, airships, geothermal energy, ethanol, corn fields, windmills.
*   **Capital:** **Nevriss City** (on cliffs above the sea).
*   **Society:**
    *   **Pursang (Purebloods):** Aristocracy, wielding powerful Spira.
    *   **Mezra (Halfbloods):** Merchants, craftsmen.
    *   **Ghorki (Lowborn):** Workers, but with rights (if they have money).

### 2. Graw (North) — Land of GROND
**"Strength, Order, Steel."**

*   **Ideology:** Militant fascism/Totalitarianism. They worship **Grond (the Stormfather)**. They believe the Mother is weak and the world belongs to the strong.
*   **Government:** **The Imperator (Iron Throne)** and his generals.
*   **Aesthetic:** Industrial, brutal. Enormous factories belching smoke, fortresses of black stone, ubiquitous pipes and gears.
*   **Capital:** **Magma City** (heated by geothermal energy).
*   **Society:**
    *   Military hierarchy. Citizen = Soldier.
    *   The weak are "recycled" in the mines.
    *   **Maki** (forced to work under threat of death).

### 3. Fragmented Kingdoms (The Shattered Lands)
A belt of territory between North and South ("the Middle Lands"), where smaller states endlessly rise and fall. **All nations on Terra began as city-states** — in the wilderness of a Super-Earth, survival without a fortified city (warmth, protection, community) was impossible. Some remained cities, others (like Nyau) grew into sprawling countries. According to the map, the most notable are:

| Location | Description | Character |
|---|---|---|
| **Beladiss (Bella & Diss)** | "Twins of the Coast" | Two sister cities thousands of km apart (like NY-LA). They control maritime routes on opposite ends of the continent. |
| **Nyau** | "Cursed Nyau" | Like all nations on Terra, Nyau began as a city-state — a city was simpler to survive in than the wilderness (warmth, protection, community). Today it is a vast country (comparable in area to China) but with sparse settlement (~25-35M inhabitants). Most of the territory is wilderness. **Why an oasis?** North of Nyau lies the **Cave of Ela** — the place where Inetis landed and spent her first 3 years. During this period, she genetically modified plants and fauna in Ela's laboratory as experiments she later took with her to Elysia. But what she started — GMO plants and organisms optimized for Achilles' conditions — spread across the surrounding land like wildfire after her departure. Over a thousand years, the entire region transformed into the most fertile area on the continent. Nyau is literally **Inetis's legacy**, though no one knows it. Legend says that when the first captain saw this beautiful land amidst the wasteland, he blurted in shock: *"Kurva Nyau!"* — and the name stuck. **Spira Crystals**: In the north of Nyau, on the edge of civilization amid the wilderness, lie underground Spira crystal mines — the primary source for the entire continent. The crystals are imported from the far east and are the latest hit on the luxury commodities market. |
| **Raiju** | "The Lake Harbor" | Major trade hub between Graw and the fragmented kingdoms. |
| **Ruins of Kitsune** | "City of Foxes" | **Originally the ancient city of Kito.** When the Maki discovered it, they found a population of fox-folk Ludi and renamed it **Kitsune**. The foxes (Vulpini) fell in love with the new name and adopted it. Today it is a legendary lost city (where Felix has his workshop and Max's home). |
| **Wolf's Pass** | "The Northern Gate" | A frozen mountain road guarded by Wolves 2.0. The only passage into Graw through the mountains. |
| **Citadela** | "The Iron Fist" | Second-largest city in Graw. |
| **Shoraven** | "The Border City" | Key point between Nevriss and the North. The place where the story begins. |

## Culture of the Varietas: Spira as Magic

This is the key difference from the other continents. Varietas **do not know** they are using nanotechnology. To them, it is **magic**.

### Elemental System (Pentagram)
Varietas interpret the functions of nanobots through elemental mysticism:

1.  **Fire (Energy):** Pyrokinesis, welding, smelting metals.
2.  **Water (Healing):** Accelerated cellular regeneration (Healing nanobots).
3.  **Earth (Matter):** Manipulation of material density, construction.
4.  **Air (Movement):** Telekinesis, levitation.
5.  **Spirit (Code):** Pure reality manipulation (forbidden/divine).

*   **Maki** are perceived as soulless "Golems."
*   **Wraiths** are perceived as "Demons" or "Hungry Ghosts."
*   **The Sickness (Glitch Rot)** is perceived as "Soul Rot" or divine punishment.

## Technological Schism

| | Nevriss (South) | Graw (North) |
|---|---|---|
| **Energy Source** | **Spira (Biological)**. People literally "bleed" energy into machines. | **Geothermal / Ethanol - Wind**. Raw industrial power. |
| **Transport** | Airships (elegant yachts), Sailing ships, Animals. | Heavy cargo Airships (Zeppelins), Armored trains. |
| **Weapons** | **Swords and Guns**. Rapier, Revolver, Spira-fireballs. Elegant combat. | **Brute Force**. Machine guns, Flamethrowers, Heavy armor. Artillery. |

## Relations with Other Continents

### Terra vs. Neuropa (West)
*   **Attitude:** Hatred and Envy.
*   **Reason (Historical Betrayal):** **The Exodus from Elysia (AY ~300).** Varietas remember being expelled (or having to flee) from the Garden of Paradise (Elysium) during the "Great Plague" (Glitch Rot). Humans ("The Old Ones") stayed behind, sealed themselves behind barriers, and left Varietas to fend for themselves in the wilds of Terra.
*   **Interaction:** None (Embargo). The occasional smuggler brings "God-tech" (a chip, a flashlight) worth a kingdom's ransom.

### The Great Spira War — AY ~850
**"The day the Mother wept in the mud."**

The decisive battle in the **Atra Narrows** beneath the Hangravall mountains (the only way into the South). A Triumvirate of Archangels (Grond, Samaell, Zaya) sought to destroy the Varietas and seize the Spira.

*   **The Descent:** Inetis descended from the heavens in the midst of the slaughter. She walked across the battlefield, ignoring the flying projectiles.
*   **Tears in the Mud:** She knelt in the bloody mud beside the dying and wept. Her crying was so desperate that it silenced the clash of arms. The shame of having made the Mother weep broke the morale of both sides.
*   **Collapse of the Triumvirate:**
    *   **Grond** (betrayed and enraged) withdrew to the North, beyond the mountains.
    *   **Zaya** (in shame) fled to Aprika.
    *   **Samaell** became a wanderer.
*   **Aftermath:** On the spot where the Mother wept, the city of **Shoraven** (City of Reconciliation/Treaty) was founded. It is sacred ground. The oldest statues here depict Inetis as a *human* (without ears), kneeling in the mud — an image the Church later "corrected" (adding cat ears and replacing her tears with pentagrams of power).

### Terra vs. Aprika (South)
*   **Attitude:** Fear and Superstition.
*   **Reason:** Aprika is "the white spot on the map." Varietas know absolutely nothing. Only legends and tavern talk.
*   **Reality:** They have no idea about the Apes civilization. If the Apes ever attack (Paladins), Terra will be in shock.
