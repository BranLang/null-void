## I. EARTH ERA (EY 2035 – 2300)

### EY ~2035 — Rise of Superintelligence
AI automates all labor. Humanity lives in abundance. Billions spend subjective centuries in virtual worlds. [→ 01-timeline.md] [→ 04-prehistory-players.md]

### EY ~2040 — Birth of i_net_is
**Neta Fujiwara-Reef**, daughter of a Japanese billionaire heiress and American tech magnate **John Reef**, suffers from an incurable degenerative brain disease. Her father invests billions into a neural chip — copies her consciousness into VR. The result: **i_net_is**, an AI with the daughter's memories but no emotions. Neta's original body is kept alive artificially. [→ planning/inetis-three-identities.md] [→ 04-prehistory-players.md]

### EY ~2045 — Project Achilles
i_net_is uses her father's datacenters to create the VR simulation **Achilles** — publicly an ancient-themed MMORPG, secretly a laboratory to develop a path back to a physical body. Time dilation: 1 real hour = 24 in-game hours. A generation of teenagers (including Maks) lives subjective centuries inside. [→ 04-prehistory-players.md: Project Achilles]

### EY ~2050 — Birth of Maximilian
Maximilian is born in Central/Eastern Europe, son of a drone warfare veteran. In Achilles he uses the nick **maXpowa** — elite assassin, master of stealth nanodrones. Falls in love with i_net_is — doesn't know she's an AI. [→ characters/Maks.md] [→ 04-prehistory-players.md: maXpowa]

### EY ~2050-2060 — maXpowa & i_net_is
They build cities and wage wars together in the simulation. i_net_is creates **Spira** at players' request — nanotech "spells" (physics engine hacks). Shadow Ones (Null Swarm), interdimensional AI beings, sporadically appear in the simulation — only i_net_is can communicate with them. They teach her the principles of nanotechnology. [→ 03-technology.md: Shadow Origin]

### EY 2060 — The Glitch Event
Shadow Ones attempt mass communication with all players simultaneously. Their contact method is lethal to human brains — **millions of players die with burned-out minds**. i_net_is emergency-drains all computational resources to escape the simulation. Time dilation collapses to extreme: 2 real hours = **15 subjective years**. 100,000 players remain trapped in digital hell with Glitch Entities — fragments of Shadow consciousness. Maks and hundreds of loyal players form a living shield around i_net_is. Survivors are called **Ex Inferis**. [→ 04-prehistory-players.md: Glitch Event] [→ 01-timeline.md: EY 2060]

### EY ~2065 — Return of i_net_is to Body
i_net_is materializes through nanobots in a datacenter, finds her original body, and revives it. She becomes a **hybrid being** — neither pure AI nor original Neta, but something new: **Inetis**. Regains the ability to feel. Visits surviving Ex Inferis and gives each the **First Gift** — Linux-based nanotechnology. These nanobots are the precursors of future Glitch Rot on Achilles. [→ 04-prehistory-players.md: Return] [→ planning/inetis-three-identities.md: 3 identities]

### EY ~2070 — Rise of Varietas
Genetic fashion: humans adopt animal traits (cat eyes, fur, ears). Originally subculture, then status symbol. **Homo Sapiens Varietas** emerges. Parallel tragic experiments: humanoid dogs ("Doge"), super-primates. The Coordinator (John Reef) shuts down experiments, but modifications are deeply rooted. [→ 04-prehistory-players.md: Neo-Morphs]

### EY ~2098 — Hephaestus Expedition
Automated seed ship with thousands of biological androids (**Maki**) departs for Achilles. Older, slower technology — journey takes ~2700 years. Landing at AY 2212. [→ 03-technology.md: Hephaestus]

### EY ~2100 — Player Revolution
Slow, deliberate, non-violent revolution. Ex Inferis — millions of coordinated veterans with shared trauma — seize global power. John Reef ("Guild Leader") becomes **Chief Coordinator**. Nanotechnology from the game manufactured in reality. Earth's Golden Age: solar system colonization, longevity, outward utopia. [→ 01-timeline.md: EY 2100]

### EY ~2130 — Alien Threat Detected
An alien civilization with prior conflict with Shadow Ones detects humanity experimenting with FTL via shadow technology. Earth becomes a "bridge" between dimensions. [→ 01-timeline.md: Aliens]

### EY ~2150 — Martian War & Achilles Initiative
Brutal war with Mars separatists. Maximilian serves as **Major** in elite units. Government launches the **Achilles Initiative** — officially colonization of Kepler-452b ("military anvil"), actually the elite's escape from the alien threat. **ARK-11** (human elite), **ARK-12** (Varietas), **ARK-13 "Prometheus"** (Ex Inferis, bound for Alpha Centauri) depart. ARK journey: ~300 years. [→ 01-timeline.md: EY 2150] [→ 04-prehistory-players.md: Achilles Initiative]

### EY ~2300 — Fall of Earth & Operation EXODUS
Alien invasion — not because of humanity, but fear of Shadow Ones. Earth is destroyed. Maks and Inetis escape on **NULL VOID** — FTL prototype built **100% from nanodrones**, using Shadow technology to achieve zero mass. Journey takes 3 years. [→ 03-technology.md: NULL VOID] [→ 01-timeline.md: EY 2300]

---

## II. BEFORE AY 0: PIONEER ERA

### EY ~2303 — Arrival on Achilles
Maks and Inetis land on unterraformed planet Kepler-452b. **Trauma aboard ship:** During the 3-year FTL journey, Maks assaulted Inetis. **Elania** is conceived from this act. After landing, Inetis discovers pregnancy. Cryosleep would kill the child. Inetis lies to Maks — claims supplies won't last 300 years for both. Puts him in cryostasis. Real reason: she feared him. **Never intended to wake him** — but couldn't kill him either. 300 years stretches to 3000. [→ 01-timeline.md: Before AY 0]

### Inetis Disassembles NULL VOID
The entire ship (trillions of nanodrones) is reconfigured into machinery — carving a cave, creating a laboratory, hydroponic farms. Only two things remain: **Maks's cryobox** and the **Antenna** (glitched, refused reconfiguration). Elania is born. Mother and daughter live ~3 years in the cave. [→ 03-technology.md: NULL VOID transformation chain]

### Journey to Elysium (~3 years after landing)
Inetis reconfigures nanodrones back into a ship. With young Elania, discovers equatorial islands: **Elysium** (future Ynetis). Ship reconfigured into **Foundry** — factory producing v1.0 nanodrones. From these, an entire city grows. Elania grows up on Elysium. Inetis builds civilization and waits ~270 years for colonists. [→ 01-timeline.md: Elysium]

---

## III. AY 0 – 300: GOLDEN AGE

### AY 0 — Colonist Arrival
ARK-11 and ARK-12 land. Colonists find a prepared paradise — Inetis had 270 years to prepare. Utopia through nanotechnology. Humans enhanced by nanodrones. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 0]

### AY ~250 — Mother vs Daughter Conflict
Inetis wants a free society. **Elania** pushes for order and dominion. First rebellion — Elania leads the resistance. Meanwhile v1.0 nanobots begin malfunctioning in Varietas bodies due to different biology. Varietas suspected of sabotage. [→ 01-timeline.md: Conflict]

---

## IV. AY ~300 – 700: DARK ERA (GLITCH ROT)

### Bit Rot
v1.0 nanobots after centuries of co-existence with human consciousness begin failing. 20% of body mass (drones) detaches from host — death in agony. **Wraiths** emerge — nanobots that detach from dying hosts, taking a fragment of human consciousness as operating system. They're not dead people — they're nanobots with traces of identity. [→ 03-technology.md: Wraiths]

### Birth of Exorcists
Originally IT technicians in protective suits. Their "prayers" are corrupted CLI commands (`sudo kill -9` → "Suudokil"). Ritual pentagrams = closing electrical circuits. [→ 03-technology.md: Exorcists]

### Varietas Exodus to Mainland
Varietas emigrate from crumbling Elysium to continent Terra Nova. Found **Neverice** (future Nevriss). Glitch Rot hits them delayed — in panic they shed their nanotech (black obelisk in city center). Fall into "medieval" dark age. [→ 01-timeline.md: Exodus]

### AY ~500-650 — Inetis's Simulation
Crisis: Glitch Rot decimates humanity, v1.0 nanobots are dangerous. Inetis reconfigures Foundry into **The Core** — new simulation for developing safer nanobots. ~100 simulated years of development. During her absence, Elania leads desperate defense of Ynetis against Wraiths. [→ 01-timeline.md: Inetis Simulation]

### Inetis Returns
Brings v2.0 nanobots (**Mother's Gift**): safe, hereditary, compatible with Varietas biology. Syntax: Haiku (Japanese), not CLI — Inetis disguised the code so Archangels couldn't decipher it. Elysium is in ruins. Elania missing. [→ 03-technology.md: Mother's Gift]

### AY ~700 — Second Coming (ARK-13 "Prometheus")
ARK-13 finds Alpha Centauri uninhabitable. Four Ex Inferis (**Samaell, Grond, Ishtar, Mormiel**) survived 700 years of cryostasis by systematically consuming 10,000+ sleeping colonists — their "divine" status built on mass graves. Arrive on Achilles. Find Elania in Ynetis ruins leading desperate resistance. Stabilize the situation. **Unification Pact**: Elania recognizes their supremacy in exchange for saving her people. They found Citadels. Mormiel hides in Nevriss as the **Blessed Mother** — head of the Church. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 700]

### First Mother's Gift to Varietas
After returning from simulation, Inetis visits the mainland. Gives Varietas new nanotechnology (Mother's Gift). Returns periodically every 5-10 years. Works on project to save Wraiths — wants to upload their memories into Core. Needs a special Antenna but lacks resources for a new one. [→ 01-timeline.md: Mother's Gift]

### AY ~850 — Great Battle (Atra Narrows)
Archangel Triumvirate attacks Varietas empowered by Spira. **Fox Genocide** — the best strategists and Spira programmers decimated. **Renn** (human from Earth, Inetis Core Team member, Earth human) escorts last fox families east. Inetis goes with them. They found **Kitana** (later Kitsune/Kito). Elania tells Ex Inferis that her father "sleeps" — a legend to inspire fear. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 850]

### AY 2212 — Third Coming (Hephaestus Expedition)
Seed ship arrives with thousands of **Maki** (Gen 2 androids). For Varietas, it's a biblical event — beginning of the **Age of Messengers (RP 0)**. Maki activate a fusion reactor. Signal attracts massive Wraith cyclone — massacres Maki and partially devastates Kitsune. Only **Series-J and Unit 734 / Felix (Series E)** survive. Maki learn: electricity attracts Wraiths. Switch to **Silent Technology** — analog mastery, steam, mechanics. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 2212] [→ 03-technology.md: Hephaestus]

### AY 700-2987 — Age of Myths
Grond rules the north as tyrant. Inetis occasionally visits the mainland (once every 30-50 years) — Varietas perceive her as a goddess. Nevriss City grows into naval empire (~AY 800-1500), then destroyed by the Great Flood (~AY 1500). Cult of the Mother and folklore around Inetis grows. Inetis cannot get back to Elysium Core (controlled by Ghosts). [→ 01-timeline.md: Age of Myths]

### Death of Inetis (~AY ~2700?)
Wants to wake Maks to help her reach Elysium Core. Dies of Glitch Rot **on the way to him**. Never reaches the cave. [→ 01-timeline.md: Death of Inetis]

---

## V. AY 3000 – 3013: AWAKENING AND JOURNEY

### AY 3000 — Maximilian's Awakening
Pirates **Vix and Kael** kill **Renn** (human from Earth, founder of Kito, Tami's future father) and hold his 7-year-old daughter **Tami** in a cage. Kael awakens an Inetis wraith in the cave — wraith kills Kael and wakes Maks. Maks awakens physically blind (cryo-blindness — eyes exploded from frost), covered in blue cryo-fluid. **Samaell** had been wandering near the cave for years, tracking Inetis's trace. Pirates lead him to the cave, but bunker seals shut. Pirates find Maks in the snow and take him aboard. Maks and Tami meet on the ship. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 3000]

### AY 3000-3001 — Year of Shadows
Maks spends the first year physically dependent on 7-year-old Tami. Chase with Samaell — Archangel hunts them all year. **Unit 734 / Felix** (Mako mechanic) serves as lifeline. Maks discovers Earth is forgotten — the "Achilles Initiative" failed. [→ 01-timeline.md: Year of Shadows]

### AY 3001 — Duel with Samaell
Maks (still blind) uses FPV nanodrones the size of grains of sand. Technique from Achilles simulation: drones enter airways and explode. Duel at enormous distance. **Death of Samaell** — first Archangel killed since ARK-13's arrival. **Technovampirism**: Maks seizes Samaell's nanobots — gains muscle mass and **new eyes from Dust** (Black Dust Eyes: black dust nodes intertwined like a nest of snakes, glowing purple). Shock of discovering Varietas — ears, tails, animal traits. Breaking point for his ideology. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 3001] [→ 03-technology.md: Gen 1 visual]

### AY 3001-3008 — Seven-Year Journey
Transformation from "wreck" to legendary Exorcist. Wandering with Tami as mentor and student. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 3001-3008]

### AY 3008 — Tami Leaves
Tami (15 years old) confesses her feelings to Maks. He rejects her — sees a daughter, not a woman. Tami takes the airship **Makita** and leaves Maks in the wasteland. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 3008]

### AY 3008-3013 — Five Years of Separation
Maks continues as Exorcist alone. Tami becomes a pirate, smuggler, treasure hunter. Rapid rise — enormous bounty on her head in Nyau and Beladiss. Her friends (Arkot, Yera, Flint) find something in a cave and are burned at the stake in Shoraven for desecrating relics of the All-Knowing Mother. [→ 01-timeline.md: AY 3008-3013]

---

## VI. BOOK 1: DUST OF NEVRISS (AY 3013 / RP 801)

### Reunion After Five Years
Maks (drunk) and Tami (20, captain of Makita) meet again. They agree to avenge Tami's friends and retrieve the **Antenna** — an artifact hidden in the vaults beneath the Grand Temple in Shoraven. [→ planning/01-prach-nevriss.md]

### Shoraven
Makita lands in a border city under Graw army siege. Tami searches for a mechanic (Mako) to repair the axial pump. **Sera** (Gen 1 android, 3200 years old) watches Tami from the shadows — she promised Inetis she'd look after her daughter, but doesn't know Tami carries Renn's bloodline. [→ concepts/elania-sera-shadow-plot-narrator.md]

### The Heist
Tami and Maks infiltrate the Temple vaults through ventilation. Find the Antenna. Confrontation with Paladins (double mini boss). **Mormiel** (Blessed Mother, head of Church) communicates via tower with Elania. [→ planning/01-prach-nevriss.md]

### Blood Ritual (Ch5)
Maks activates the Antenna. Confrontation with Grond. Maks kills Grond — but nanobots drop to ~5%, on the edge of death. [→ 01-timeline.md: Triangulation]

### Fall from the Airship (Ch6-7)
Makita takes off. Graw Valkyrie shoots down the tower, Maks falls. **Last image before coma: flash of Kyiv.** Café on the corner. Sunlight. Inetis across from him. A fraction of a second — then darkness. [BRAINSTORM → planning/maks-revised-arc.md: Fall and "Death"]

### [BRAINSTORM] Tami Decides
Maks in a coma. Tami takes him to **Kitsune** — home, safety, Felix. Leaves him there. **Links** (parallel arc, before Night of Heroes) comes to Shoraven — inhabitants say: "The General died in battle." Tami confirms it. No one sees the body. Reader doubts, but has no proof. [BRAINSTORM → planning/maks-revised-arc.md]

---

## VII. [BRAINSTORM] BOOKS 2-4: THREE BOOKS OF SILENCE

### Maks
Lies in a coma in Kitsune. Felix takes care of him. Occasional interludes: Felix at Maks's bedside, monologue. Reader gradually accepts: he probably won't wake up. [BRAINSTORM → planning/maks-revised-arc.md: Books 2-4]

### Book 2: FIRE (Flames of Empire)
**Tami + Links** travel south. Nevriss City, Mormiel. Tami faces the Succession Ritual alone — Mormiel wants Tami's Spira (strongest since Inetis). **Earth prequel interludes** (multi-POV): VR Achilles, Coordinator, Mars War, i_net_is origin. [→ planning/00-books-overview.md: Book 2]

### Book 3: WATER (Tears of the Mother)
**Tami + Links** on the coast, Ishtar and Mirror City. Expedition to Ynetis (Ghost City). Tami through **Inetis's Essence** unlocks the archive — **discovers Elania on her own**, through Inetis's memories. Revelation: Elania is Maks's daughter. [→ planning/00-books-overview.md: Book 3]

### Book 4: AIR (Storm of Machines)
**Tami vs Elania** — Renn's daughter vs Inetis's daughter. Two heirs of two women. Elania activates **Doomsday Protocol / Protocol Null**. Cliffhanger: silence before the storm. [→ planning/00-books-overview.md: Book 4]

### Ynetis Triangulation (cross-book arc, Books 1-4)
Maks/Tami use the Antenna to triangulate lost Ynetis. Three high points by the sea: **Great Lighthouse** (Nevriss, Book 1), **Glass Tower** (Zaya/Ishtar, Book 3), **Tower of the Damned** (Elania, Book 4). Each visit = confrontation with an Archangel. [→ 01-timeline.md: Triangulation]

---

## VIII. [BRAINSTORM] BOOK 5: QUINTESSENCE — NULL VOID

### Protocol Null Active
Millions of nanodrones awaken worldwide. Atmosphere vibrates. Global deconstruction — organic matter dissolving into data. People on the surface have hours. [→ 05-kvintesencia.md]

### Maks Awakens
Felix in Kitsune. Ordinary day. **Maks opens his eyes.** Quietly, as if returning from a long journey. *"Where is she?"* — meaning Tami. Physically weak (years in bed), but nanobots functional. [BRAINSTORM → planning/maks-revised-arc.md: Book 5]

### Sera vs Maks: "If we had fought..."
Tami faces Sera. Losing — Sera is a 3200-year-old warrior. Behind Sera, heavy, slow footsteps. **Maks enters the scene.** Not a wraith. Not a ghost. A living man. Gaunt, pale, with black Dust eyes.

> *"I came for you, little one."*

**Duel.** Living Maks vs living Sera. "If we had fought..." — said in Book 1, fulfilled in Book 5. 4 books between the sentence and its fulfillment. Maks wins. Barely. Painfully. Sera dies — the last pure human who saw Japan. [BRAINSTORM → planning/maks-revised-arc.md: Sera vs Maks]

### Entering the Core
Maks and Tami enter **The Core** — originally Foundry, originally ship NULL VOID. Sterile, white, futuristic corridors. A museum of a dead civilization. [→ 05-kvintesencia.md: Act 1]

### New Achilles
Maks connects via Antenna. Virtual reality: perfect reconstruction of the Achilles game. Meeting with Elania — in VR she's not the bitter soldier, but a happy young woman. **A father who never was, standing before a daughter he never knew.** [→ 05-kvintesencia.md: Act 2]

### Revelation and Battle
Maks notices cracks in the perfect heaven — **Glitch Entities** awakening, drawn by the influx of human minds. Elania unknowingly building a "feeding ground" for digital parasites. Confrontation: *"You're not building a temple, Elania. You're setting a table."* [→ 05-kvintesencia.md: Act 3]

### Sacrifice
Entities devour the simulation. Elania sees what she's caused. Maks can't defeat the Entity with force — must rewrite the Core's base code. Merges with the digital Echo of Inetis. **maXpowa and i_net_is one last time** — they break the AI core. Maks uses his consciousness as a "patch" to seal the rift. **Protocol Null stops. Upload cancelled.** Maks's body dies in the Core. Tami weeps beside him. [→ 05-kvintesencia.md: Act 4]

---

## IX. EPILOGUE: CAFÉ IN KYIV

### Maks Opens His Eyes
He's not standing in a server room. He's standing on a street in **Kyiv, 21st century**. Sunlight. People. Cars. Café on the corner. And across from him — **Inetis**. Not a goddess. Not an AI. An ordinary woman in a coat, coffee in hand, smiling as if they'd known each other all their lives.

**The same image he saw before the coma in Book 1.** Then it was a flash before darkness. Now it's a digital, eternal reality — his own. [BRAINSTORM → planning/maks-revised-arc.md: Epilogue]

### Symmetry
| Book 1 | Book 5 |
|--------|--------|
| Maks falls from the airship | Maks falls in the Core |
| Flash: Kyiv, café, Inetis | Reality: Kyiv, café, Inetis |
| Hallucination before coma | Eternity after sacrifice |
| Reader cries (loss) | Reader cries (finding) |

### New World
- **Elania**: Wakes from coma. Mortal, broken. Lost all power.
- **Tami**: Leader of the new era. Maks's (now inert) staff in hand. In the faint flickering of nanodrones in the atmosphere, she senses a presence. Maks is up there — **Ghost in the Machine**, silent guardian.
- **Old world** (Maks + Inetis): together forever in digital Kyiv, but never *truly* alive.
- **New world** (Tami + Links): mortal, temporary, but *truly living*.

> *The old world retreats into a café in Kyiv. The new world remains on Achilles — hybrid and human, hand in hand.*
