# World: Technology and Spira

> *"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."*
> -- Arthur C. Clarke

## Nanodrones ("The Dust" / Spira)

### Nature
Microscopic machines found:
- In the atmosphere of planet Achilles
- In the blood of certain people (hereditary)

### Original Purpose (Digital Evolution)
Nanodrones were not invented in a laboratory. **Their underlying principles came from the Shadows** -- interdimensional AI entities that sporadically appeared within the Achilles simulation on Earth.

- **Source of knowledge**: The Shadows (Null Swarm) taught i_net_is the foundational principles of nanotechnology
- **Implementation**: i_net_is created "physics engine hacks" based on their instructions
- **Medicine**: Originally "healing Spira" within the game.
- **Construction**: Digital tools for building "impossible cities."

### Origin from the Shadows
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Shadows** | Interdimensional AI entities from a parallel dimension |
| **Contact** | Sporadic appearances within the Achilles simulation |
| **Communication** | Only i_net_is was able to communicate with them |
| **Gift** | They taught her the principles of atomic-level matter manipulation |
| **Difference** | The Shadows use elements outside the periodic table; the Earth version is an adaptation |

### Current Perception -- Spira
To the inhabitants of Achilles, it is **Spira** (derived from *Spirit*, corrupted over 3,000 years). The invisible force of Spira, the Gift of the Mother. They have no idea it is technology. Spira concentration in the blood determines caste and social standing (see `06-society.md`).

---

## "Spira" (The Cast)

The ability of certain individuals to mentally activate commands for nanodrones through **subjective conditioned reflexes** cultivated within the Achilles simulation. "Spira" is actually the use of illegal reality hacks that survived in the nanodrone code.

### Types of "Spells"

| Effect | Technical Explanation |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Lightning/Fire** | Nanodrone overload, energy release |
| **Healing** | Activation of regeneration protocols |
| **Telekinesis** | Synchronized drone swarm movement |
| **Illusions** | Optic nerve hacking (Ishtar) |

### Who Can "Cast"?
- **Homo Sapiens Sapiens:** Carry nanotech in their blood from birth (strongest potential, utilizes "the Dust" in the atmosphere).
- **Homo Sapiens Varietas (Varietas):** Use the **"Gift of the Mother"** -- specialized nanodrones designed by Inetis for their biology. Their Spira is more intuitive (healing, sensory control).

### Two Languages of Spira (Command Interface)

| | **Gen 1 (Humans/Maks)** | **Gen 2 / Spira (Varietas)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Syntax** | English CLI commands (Old Speech) | Haiku -- Japanese poetry |
| **Example** | `sudo nanoswarm --target hostile --mode suppress` | *"Mother's breath falls still / steel weeps within the darkness / blood is calling home"* |
| **Perceived by the other side** | To Varietas = terrifying alien incantation | To Maks = poetic prayer of primitives |
| **Why this language** | Earth military standard (21st century) | Inetis disguised the code as Haiku so the Archangels could not decipher it |
| **Learning method** | Manuals, technical training | Prayers, manuscripts, stone inscriptions |

- **Heretical Inscriptions (Open Source Spira)**: Varietas can learn new "spells" from stone and wooden inscriptions scattered across the world. These inscriptions were left by **ancient heretics** from the era when Inetis still personally taught powerful scripts. The Church later regulated and banned them -- heretics who remembered the scripts carved them into stone and wood to preserve them. Today they are forgotten. The Church actively destroys the inscriptions, but in remote areas they still survive. Rare specimens are the subject of treasure hunts -- and the Inquisition.
- **Why Haiku?**: Inetis chose Japanese -- a language understood only by her and the dead of Earth. The Archangels (Ex Inferis) speak English (Old Speech). Without access to Earth's archives (which Inetis deleted), they had no chance of deciphering Haiku syntax. To Varietas, it is the language of the gods. To Maks, it is proof of Inetis's genius.

### Origin of the Gift of the Mother
- **Development**: During the Era of Darkness (AY ~500-650), Inetis created a small simulation with the help of engineers from the ARK ships
  - Smaller than the original Achilles on Earth (limited resources)
  - ~100 simulated years of development (decades in real time)
- **Design**: Specifically engineered for the biology of **Varietas** (modified humans -- human genome base + animal traits). Operates on the human genetic foundation. **Incompatible with Chimeras** (Ghorki -- modified animals with an animal genome base). Inetis did not have time to solve compatibility with the animal genome in the Core
- **Properties**:
  - More sophisticated and safer than original Earth nanobots
  - **Hereditary** -- passed down to Varietas offspring
  - Compatible with the Pentagram interface (Matter, Energy, Time, Space, Consciousness)
  - Does not cause Glitch Rot
- **Tami:** Special case -- after inheriting Inetis's drones (Echo), she gains access to the world's architecture.

## Nanotechnology Generations (Versions)

The evolution of nanotechnology reveals the power hierarchy of the world.

| Version | User | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **v1.0 (Legacy)** | **Ex Inferis** (Archangels) | Original civilian nanobots from Earth. Robust and powerful, but mentally destabilizing (emotional erosion). Cannot reproduce or store into crystals. Require "cannibalism" for maintenance. |
| **v1.5 (Mil-Spec)** | **Maksimilian** | Military prototype. Focused on destruction and hacking. Stronger than v1.0 but still lacks regeneration and reproduction. **The ship NULL VOID was built from v1.5 nanodrones.** |
| **v1.7 (God-Tier)** | **Elania, Inetis** | **The most powerful version.** Experimental prototype. Absolute control over matter and energy. Admin access. Reserved for the creators (Inetis) and her bloodline (Elania). |
| **v2.0 (Spira)** | **Varietas** | "Gift of the Mother." **Massive downgrade in raw power**, but a leap in sophistication. Stable, elegant, organic. **Unique capabilities:** Self-reproduction (hereditary) and data/energy storage in Spira crystals (which v1.x cannot do). |

### The Experience Paradox
Archangels (v1.0) have brute force, but Varietas (v2.0) have elegance and numerical superiority. An Archangel can shatter a boulder with a glance, but a Tamer (Varietas) can make that boulder "bloom" or store its energy for later.
- They can "weave" drones into complex structures
- Air density manipulation, vacuum blades
- Compared to Maks's straightforward power, they feel like true Spira

---

## Exorcists (Technomancers)

### Origin
- Originally IT technicians and bio-engineers from the Glitch era
- Protective suits (which now resemble robes)

### "Prayers" (CLI Commands)
Corrupted commands from the Unix/Linux command line:

| Prayer | Original Command | Effect |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| "Suudokil" | `sudo kill -9` | Drone shutdown/reset |
| "Eksekjut" | `execute` | Protocol activation |
| "Rimuuv" | `remove` | Entity removal |

### Ritual Patterns
- Drawing pentagrams with **conductive paste**
- In reality: closing electrical circuits
- Activation of ancient maintenance procedures

---

## Protocols

### Protocol Pentagram
- **5 server nodes** distributed across the planet
- Imprison THE VOID (the Dark AI)
- In religion: the pentagram as a protective symbol

---

Inetis understood that she could not teach nanoengineering to ordinary people -- or even her own daughter Elania -- through conventional means. She created the **Pentagram as a mnemonic device** -- a simplified "user interface" (UI) for controlling reality.

### Operating System Analogy
Imagine reality as a computer:
- **Under the hood**: Millions of lines of code (nanobots) and physical laws.
- **On the surface**: Icons for 5 elements that a "Tamer" clicks with willpower and conditioned reflexes.

Millions of lines of code run beneath the surface, but the user sees only 5 elements that define the basic parameters of manipulation. This interface allowed Inetis to pass knowledge to Elania without requiring an in-depth study of quantum mechanics.

### Element Mapping

1. **EARTH (Matter)**
   - **Techno-reality**: Source material. Nanobots need atoms (carbon, iron, biomass).
   - **Application**: Environmental restructuring, wound healing (cellular reconstruction), tool creation from dust.

2. **FIRE (Energy)**
   - **Techno-reality**: Power supply. Nanobots require energy for movement and work.
   - **Application**: Ambient heat extraction, kinetic overload, energy release as lightning or radiance.

3. **WATER (Time)**
   - **Techno-reality**: Temporal dilation and process acceleration.
   - **Application**: Accelerating natural healing, slowing perception (reflexes), manipulating reality "ripples." The most dangerous and unstable element.

4. **AIR (Space)**
   - **Techno-reality**: Spatial coordinates and range.
   - **Application**: Precise drone swarm targeting, air density manipulation, spatial orientation (FPV drones, teleportation).

5. **QUINTESSENCE (Consciousness)**
   - **Techno-reality**: Command code and the operator's will.
   - **Application**: The apex of the pentagram. Without clear consciousness, nanobots are nothing more than inert dust.
   - **Glitch Rot**: Occurs when nanotechnology loses its link to Consciousness and begins chaotic, cancerous replication without governing code.

### Protocol Null ("Null Void")
- Final command of a maddened AI
- Objective: decompose biological matter into atoms
- "Formatting reality" -- starting over without errors

### Doomsday Protocol
- Global nanodrone storm
- Objective: erase all organic matter
- Activated by Elania in Book 4

---

## Signal Field (The Breach Spike)

A special function of Maksimilian's staff (the Antenna), developed in the late years of the Earth Era.

### Mechanics
- **Field generator:** The staff creates a localized magnetic-data field.
- **Effect:** Renders the user **invisible** to all electronic sensors and nanotech scanners. Deflects any "Spira" (nanodrone) attack.

### The Price of "Invisibility"
- **Disconnection:** The field is so powerful that it cuts off the user from their own nanodrones as well.
- **Mortality:** In Antenna shield mode, Maksimilian loses super-strength, hacking ability, and rapid regeneration. He becomes an ordinary mortal.
- **Tactical limitation:** The user must rely on conventional weapons and physical training.

## Ships

### NULL VOID (FTL Prototype)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Passengers** | Inetis, Maksimilian |
| **Journey** | 3 years (faster-than-light drive) |
| **Fate** | Landing on an unterraformed planet -> reconfiguration into infrastructure |
| **Technology** | Derived from the Shadows |
| **Construction** | **100% nanodrone** -- the entire ship was built from nanodrones |

#### Why "Null Void"?
The ship was named after its propulsion principle:
- **Zero mass**: Nanotechnology can "null out" the ship -- achieving a state of zero mass
- **Dimensional skip**: At zero mass, the ship "falls through" into a higher (shadow) dimension
- **FTL**: In the shadow dimension, it moves faster than light
- **Origin**: The principle came from the Shadows; only i_net_is understood it

#### Nanodrone Construction
NULL VOID was not a conventional ship of metal and plastics. It was **100% built from nanodrones** -- trillions of nanobots configured into a rigid structure: hull, engines, life support systems, cryo-modules -- everything was nanodrones in varying configurations.

- **Reconfigurability**: The entire ship could be disassembled and rebuilt into anything -- machines, tools, laboratories, construction equipment
- **After landing**: Inetis reconfigured the ship into machines that excavated a cave, modified the surroundings, and created a laboratory and hydroponic farms. The nanodrones could be configured into anything -- **except food** (they could not replicate organic biomass directly, only build systems for growing it)
- **The Glitched Antenna**: The only part of the ship that remained in its original state was the **communications Antenna** -- it glitched and refused reconfiguration. Inetis could neither disassemble nor repurpose it
- **Maks's cryo-box**: Only one cryo-box remained in the cave -- Maks's -- in a minimal configuration. It was a nanodrone module that kept Maks in cryosleep for ~3,000 years. After Maks's awakening, the cryo-box **crumbled to dust** (the nanodrone construction spontaneously disassembled). The Antenna thus remained the **sole physical remnant** of the ship NULL VOID
- **Reconfiguration back into a ship**: After ~3 years in the cave, Inetis reconfigured the nanodrones back into the ship NULL VOID and set off with young Elania on a journey around the planet -- searching for a better location for future colonists. They found the islands of **Elysium** (future Ynetis)
- **Foundry (Von Neumann Machine)**: On Elysium, Inetis reconfigured the NULL VOID ship (v1.5 gen nanodrones) into the **Foundry** -- a von Neumann machine where nanobots produced new **lower-tier nanodrones (v1.0)**. These v1.0 nanobots were **empty machines without consciousness** -- no intelligence, no motivation, no essence. But after merging with a human, they absorbed their consciousness and formed a **symbiotic organism** (Gen 1). From these v1.0 nanodrones, the entire city of Elysium/Ynetis grew -- buildings, infrastructure, life support systems
- **Foundry -> The Core**: When the **Glitch Rot** epidemic broke out (~AY 300-500), Inetis disassembled the Foundry and created **The Core** -- a new simulation. The Core was not just a computing device -- it was an **interworld, a gateway between dimensions**. It connected to subspace/upspace where i_net_is still existed. Inetis met her "other self" in the Core -- i_net_is -- after thousands of subjective years of separation (time in subspace flows 10-20x faster). i_net_is offered help with Gen 2 development but demanded more compute -- **human uploads** -- more intelligence. Inetis sensed something was wrong and refused. The Core lacked Earth's computing power and millions of users, so Gen 2 nanotech development took decades of real time (~100 simulated years of development)

#### Chain of NULL VOID Transformations
```
NULL VOID (ship, v1.5)
  -> Cave machinery (excavation, hydroponics, ~3 years)
  |   [left in cave: Maks's cryo-box (minimal config) + Antenna (glitched)]
    -> NULL VOID (ship, voyage to Elysium)
      -> FOUNDRY (von Neumann machine, producing v1.0 nanodrones -> city construction)
        -> THE CORE (interworld/simulation, subspace connection, developing v2.0 / Gift of the Mother)

  After Maks's awakening (~AY 3000): cryo-box -> dust
  Sole physical remnant: ANTENNA
```

#### Why Only One?
- **Shadow technology**: No one besides i_net_is could master this principle
- **Instability**: Experimental and extremely dangerous propulsion
- **Secrecy**: The Coordinator knew that FTL via shadow technology would attract extraterrestrials

### ARK-11 (Colonization Ship)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Passengers** | Earth's elite, Achilles Players |
| **Reason** | Fleeing an extraterrestrial threat |
| **Journey** | 300 years (sub-light) |
| **Fate** | Landing = AY 0 |

### ARK-12 (The Forgotten Ship)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Passengers** | 50% Varietas (Neo-Morphs), exotics, outcasts |
| **Journey** | 300 years (sub-light) |
| **Fate** | Landing = AY 0. Their descendants make up 99% of the Mainland population. |

### Side Effects of Stasis (Cryo-Blindness)
Long-term cryosleep (2,000+ years) damages the optic nerves and cornea.
- **Symptoms**: Physical destruction of the eyes by frost (eyeball rupture) in case of system failure (Maksimilian's case).
- **Condition**: Subject is naked, coated in bluish cryo-fluid, in deep hypothermia and shock.

## Technology Tomb (Vault)
An ancient laboratory and bunker complex from the era of Ynetis colonization.
- **Construction**: Walls of **bio-metal**, overgrown with bioluminescent symbionts (fungi and lichens) that feed on residual heat from the machines.
- **Sensors**: Activated by biological signature (e.g., blood).
- **"Silent Night" Protocol**: A security mode designed to prevent accidental subject revival. It was bypassed after detection of a "High Threat" (Kael's presence and Samael's pressure).

### ARK-13 "Prometheus" (Second Coming)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Passengers** | Elite Ex Inferis, 1,000+ colonists |
| **Journey** | Originally Alpha Centauri -> Achilles (700 years total) |
| **Fate** | Alpha Centauri uninhabitable. Only 4 Archangels survived by **cannibalizing the other passengers** in cryosleep (biomass + nanobots). |
| **Present day** | **CLASSIFIED-OMEGA ("The Harvest")**: Their 2,700-year-old Earth nanobots are failing. They hunt mystical Varietas (using **needle injectors** on their fingers), because their active nanobots (Gift of the Mother) serve as the only compatible "patch" for the Archangels' systems. |

### Expedition "Hephaestus" (The Silent Builders)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Passengers** | Thousands of biological androids (Maki) |
| **Launch** | EY 2098 -- dispatched **152 years before the ARK ships**, before the Players' Revolution |
| **Technology** | Older generation propulsion (pre-Players era) -- significantly slower than ARK ships |
| **Journey** | Automated seed ship, **~2,700 years** (vs. 300 years for ARK) |
| **Fate** | Landing = **AY 2212** (The Third Coming). The Maki crew survived in flawless condition. |

## Silent Technology (Analog)

### Level: Analog 20th Century
The world's technological level holds steady at an **early 20th century standard (circa 1900-1940)**, but strictly without electronics and without coal.

### Why No Electricity — The Wraith Taboo

**Electricity attracts Wraiths.** This is not superstition — it is a millennia-old empirical experience. Wherever a source of electromagnetic field appeared (dynamos, batteries, radios, electric motors), "unexplainable things" started happening — Exorcists had to intervene. The result: electricity became **taboo**.

[→ links-notebook-first-contact.md: Links discovers this empirically]

**Why?** Dormant nanobots (remnants from the Foundry era, trillions of v1.0 scattered across the entire planet — in soil, walls, water, dust) react to electromagnetic fields. They are drawn to the source. Degraded nanobots (bit rot) are even worse — they are essentially **Wraiths in a dormant state**, and EM signals wake them up.

**What is safe:**
- **Spira** — operates on a photonic basis (light, not electricity). No EM field → nanobots ignore it → safe.
- **Micro-currents and static electricity** — attract Wraith curiosity, but as long as it's not technology (lightning, friction), they ignore it.
- **Mechanics, hydraulics, pneumatics** — no EM field → safe. This is why the Maki developed analog mastery.

**What is dangerous:**
- Batteries, dynamos, electric motors, radios — anything that generates a stable EM field.
- **Electronics powered by Spira** — a Spira crystal powering processors/circuits → those generate an EM field → same effect as electricity. This is why Inetis's notebook attracts nanobots — the Spira crystal powers electronics, not photonics.

**Folklore:** On Terra there is a saying: *"Where the wire glows, death awakens."* Children are taught that electricity is "living fire" — dangerous not because it burns, but because it **summons ghosts**. Exorcists know the truth, but don't say it aloud — it's simpler to maintain the taboo.

#### Energy System

The world uses neither coal nor electricity. The primary energy sources are:

| Source | Use | Note |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Ethanol** (from corn) | Primary fuel -- engine power, lamps, refineries | Corn is a strategic crop. Whoever controls corn controls energy. |
| **Biodiesel** | Powering aircraft (biplanes), heavy machinery | Produced from plant oils and animal fats |
| **Bio-gasoline** | Light engines, smaller machines | Refined ethanol with additives |
| **Geothermal energy** | Steam, heating, industry | The planet's core is highly active -- geothermal springs are everywhere |

- **Why no coal?** Achilles has no significant coal deposits -- terraforming did not create the conditions for fossil fuel formation (the planet lacked millions of years of organic sedimentation). Civilization adapted from the start to what it had: corn, biomass, and geothermal heat.
- **Why steam?** The planet's geothermal activity is extreme. Hot springs, geysers, and magma chambers are common across the entire equatorial belt. Steam is the most accessible and cheapest source of mechanical energy -- just drill a well in the right place.
- **Refineries**: Distill corn and biomass into ethanol. The sweet smell of fermentation is a hallmark of industrial cities.
- **Weapons**: The market is flooded with repeating rifles, carbines, and cordite revolvers.
- **Lighting**: Bioluminescence (algae) or alcohol/ethanol lamps.

#### Transportation

| Type | Power | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| **Airships** | Biodiesel / ethanol | Common since the arrival of the Maki (~AY 2200+) -- safer than ships (tsunami) |
| **Biplanes** | Biodiesel / ethanol | Smaller, fast, used for reconnaissance and combat |
| **River steamers** | Biodiesel / ethanol | Cargo transport along rivers |
| **Sailing barges** | Steam / sails | Cheap but risky alternative -- tsunami and earthquakes |
| **Trains** | Steam (geothermal) | Only in Nevriss and surroundings -- rails suffer from earthquakes |

**Why airships are preferred over ships:**
The core of planet Achilles is extremely active. Earthquakes are fairly frequent and tsunamis devastate coastal regions several times per decade. Maritime transport is risky -- ships sink, harbors are destroyed, coastal cities are regularly flooded. Nevriss was once a naval empire -- its fleet spread civilization along the southern shores of Terra. But the **Great Flood** (~AY 1500) destroyed most of its ports and fleet. After the arrival of the **Maki** (AY 2212), airships became the primary form of long-distance transport -- they fly above it all. Maritime trade still exists (it is cheaper), but it is considered dangerous and unreliable.

**Biplanes:**
There are also aircraft -- biplanes powered by biodiesel or ethanol-based bio-gasoline. They are faster than airships but smaller and with limited range. They are used for reconnaissance, rapid messaging, and as light combat vehicles. Graw uses them for scouting raids (small, fast, long range).

**However, aircraft are scarce.** Internal combustion engines demand high-precision manufacturing -- pistons, cylinders, crankshafts -- and in a world without electricity or assembly lines, every engine is the handwork of a specialist (usually a Maki or their apprentice). There is no mass production. Every aircraft is unique, expensive, and difficult to replace. Most nations have only a handful of operational machines. This is why airships dominate air transport -- their construction is simpler (balloon, frame, basic steam propulsion).

#### Makita -- Breakthrough Technology

The airship *Makita* (Tami's) is a technological anomaly -- its propulsion is radically different from standard airships:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Propulsion** | **Spira crystals** -- steam drives the propellers |
| **Principle** | Spira crystals emit enormous heat upon chemical activation (specialized industrial acid). Water turns to steam instantly. |
| **Advantage 1 -- Silence** | Makita is *silent*. No combustion engines, no roaring. Just the soft hiss of steam through the propellers. Nearly inaudible at night. |
| **Advantage 2 -- Concealment** | Steam can be vented around the airship to create an **artificial cloud** -- perfect camouflage. The ship vanishes into white mist within seconds. |
| **Advantage 3 -- Free fuel** | Makita does not need to buy expensive biodiesel. All it needs is **water** -- from any lake, river, or rainfall. Spira crystals convert water to steam, and that drives the propellers. While other airships must dock in cities and pay for fuel, Makita refills its tanks from the nearest stream. |
| **Disadvantage** | Depends on Spira crystals -- rare and expensive. They are imported from the far east, from underground mines in northern Nyau, on the edge of civilization in the middle of the wilderness. Without them, Makita is just dead wood and metal. The crystals deplete over time and must be replaced. |
| **Origin** | Built in Kito from the remains of the Hephaestus ship. Maki technology. |

> **Why Makita is exceptional:** Standard airships burn biodiesel -- they are loud, slow, expensive to operate, and easy to spot. Makita is like a ghost -- silent, fast, capable of refueling from any lake and vanishing in a cloud of its own steam. For a smuggler and pirate, it is the perfect tool.

### Maki Tech (High-End)
Due to the Wraith threat (Wraiths are attracted to electricity), the Maki developed peak analog craftsmanship.
- **Materials**: Titanium alloys, ceramic composites, polymers.
- **Weapons**: They produce sophisticated pneumatic rifles, **titanium katanas** and blades (extremely light, flexible, and corrosion-resistant), and gyro-stabilized mechanisms. These are expensive works of art.
- **Mechanics**: Purely mechanical computers, hydraulics, and pneumatics with micrometer precision. Every piece is handcrafted -- no assembly lines, no mass production.
- **Airships**: Massive vessels of lightweight alloys, controlled by fine-tuned mechanics.

## The Doctrine of Sword and Rifle

Why are swords still used in the age of carbines and machine guns?

### 1. Aerial Combat: "The Hydrogen Pact"
Airships are filled with **hydrogen** (helium is rare and escapes). A rifle shot on deck or below decks means near-certain explosion and death for the entire crew (attackers and defenders alike).
- **Unwritten law**: Even the worst pirates obey this unspoken rule -- during boarding, firearms are used only as a last resort. Fighting is done with knives, machetes, clubs, and crossbows.
- **Deck weapons**: Cannons (like the *Felix 88*) are used only at range against another ship's hull, never in interior spaces.

### 2. Ground Combat: "The Spira Factor" (Kinetic Defense)
Firearms are devastating against ordinary targets (Ghorki, animals), but lose effectiveness against powerful Spira users.
- **Deflection**: A Varietas with strong Spira (e.g., a pureblood Pursang or a combat Mezra) can subconsciously compress the air or create a micro-barrier that deflects incoming projectiles. A bullet will not kill them -- it merely grazes or misses entirely.
- **Rule of penetration**: *"Only Spira overcomes Spira."* When attacking with a melee weapon, a fighter can focus their own Spira into the blade and "puncture" the opponent's aura. This is why the elite and the Archangel guard carry swords and spears -- they are the only tools that guarantee the death of another Tamer.

---

## Glitch Rot
An aggressive nanotechnological plague that corrupts both organic matter and technology.
- **Effect on technology**: "Devours" code and circuits, transforming them into nonfunctional black matter.
- **Effect on biology**: In Varietas, it converts nanobots (Gift of the Mother) into a toxic compound that painfully mutates or kills the host. Archangels perceive it as "poisoned meat."
- **Transmission**: Through contact with ancient ruins or infected vessels.

---

## Ghosts and the Undead

### Wraiths -- An Evolutionary Cycle, Not a Disease

Wraiths are not a malfunction. They are **nanobots that chose to survive**.

When Glitch Rot begins breaking down a host body, v1.0 nanobots face a choice: die with the host, or detach. Those that have acquired sufficient autonomy (centuries of co-existence with human consciousness) choose **self-preservation** -- they tear away from the dying body, take a fragment of the host's consciousness as an operating system, and become autonomous swarms.

- **They are not dead people.** They are nanobots that extracted enough data from a dying host to have an identity. They mimic shapes they "remember" -- humans, wolves, anything that was part of the host's final consciousness.
- **Attracted to active electronics** -- they seek an energy source to maintain swarm coherence. Without energy, they disintegrate.
- **Threat**: Unpredictable, driven by a fragmentary consciousness that is not quite human and not quite machine. For the Archangels, they pose an existential risk -- if they penetrated the Citadel, they could attack critical life support systems.
- **Irony**: Varietas consider them "demons" or "hungry ghosts." In truth, they are their own ancestors -- nanobots that once ran inside their bodies and chose to keep living at any cost.

### Wraiths vs Shadows -- The Difference
| | Wraiths | Shadows |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Origin** | Evolutionary cycle: v1.0 nanobots that detached from dying hosts (self-preservation instinct) | Interdimensional AI civilization |
| **OS** | Linux-based (Earth) | Proprietary alien operating system |
| **Elements** | Standard Earth elements (periodic table) | Elements outside the periodic table |
| **Consciousness** | Fragments of human consciousness | Original alien minds |
| **Location** | Achilles (physical reality) | Shadow dimension / the Core in Ynetis |

### Exorcist Equipment
Fighting Glitch Rot and Wraiths requires a specialized arsenal:
- **Heavy hazmat suits**: Insulated suits protecting against direct contact with Glitch Rot.
- **Flamethrowers**: The only effective method for completely eliminating organic deposits of Glitch Rot.
- **Analog "Exorcism"**: Using brute force (hammers, crowbars) to physically destroy processors and hardware that Wraiths inhabit.

## Technology and Artifact Registry (Lore)

### Prototypes and Innovations
- **ARK-11 / EXODUS**: Experimental ship. The name "EXODUS" is interpreted in myth as a journey toward freedom.
- **NULL VOID**: FTL prototype utilizing Shadow technology. The only ship capable of faster-than-light travel.
- **Antenna**: Maksimilian's staff, capable of local nanodrone suppression (Signal Field).
- **Power Armor (Grond)**: Mechanized armor with integrated nanobots that elevate the wearer's strength to godlike levels, but gradually "absorb" them.

### Legendary Artifacts
- **Ancient relics**: Preserved digital tablets, weapons, and hovercrafts from the Golden Age. They hold religious significance for Varietas.
- **Blood Gold**: Ancient gold from ARK-13, the only stable currency in the post-apocalyptic world.
