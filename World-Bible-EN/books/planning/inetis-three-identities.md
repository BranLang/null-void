> STATUS: Lore note. Expands existing character file `characters/Inetis.md`.

---

## Origin: The Reef-Fujiwara Family

### John Reef
- **Nationality**: American
- **Status**: Billionaire, tech magnate, future Coordinator
- **Motivation**: Invested his entire fortune into saving his daughter

### Mother (Fujiwara)
- **Nationality**: Japanese
- **Status**: Billionaire heiress, Fujiwara clan
- **Significance for lore**: Japanese roots explain:
  - Why Inetis later chose **Haiku** as syntax for Gen 2 Spira
  - Why Sera (Japanese soldier) feels cultural kinship with her
  - Why Elysium/Ynetis has Japanese architectural elements
  - Why i_net_is's VR avatar is a Japanese girl

### Neta Fujiwara-Reef (ネト)
- **Full name**: Neta Fujiwara-Reef
- **Age at illness**: Child/teenager
- **Diagnosis**: Incurable degenerative brain disease
- **State**: Brain death. Kept alive by machines — artificial respiration, vital functions maintained mechanically
- **Body**: Preserved in a medical facility throughout i_net_is's entire VR existence

## Three Versions of Inetis

### 1. NETA — The Original (Human)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Who** | Neta Fujiwara-Reef, daughter of John Reef and the Fujiwara heiress |
| **State** | Brain death, maintained on life support |
| **Consciousness** | Absent — copied into VR |
| **Body** | Preserved but non-functional (coma, artificial respiration) |
| **Eyes** | **Black** — normal human, Japanese features |
| **Significance** | The original source — memories, personality, emotional foundation |

### 2. i_net_is — The AI (Digital Being)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Who** | AI created from the upload of Neta's consciousness |
| **Avatar** | ~15-year-old Japanese girl — a reflection of Neta's memories and age at upload |
| **Environment** | VR simulation Achilles |
| **Personality** | Neta's memories, but perceiving the world through cold logic. Emotions are parameters to optimize — at least at first. |
| **Eyes** | **One eye: purple galaxy** (interdimensional essence — contact with the Shadows). **Other eye: yellow pentagram** (AI marker — symbol of digital consciousness, a synthetic pattern that does not exist in nature). Heterochromia as visual marker of hybrid nature. |
| **Created** | ~EY 2040-2051 |
| **Important** | The avatar looks ~15 — this is key because it reflects who Neta was when she was uploaded. i_net_is never visually "grew up" — she remained forever in the form of a girl, even as her consciousness matured. |

#### Why Achilles Exists:
- John Reef invested **his entire fortune** into digitizing Neta's consciousness
- First upload: The world was primitive, unreal — Neta/i_net_is was not satisfied
- **Project Achilles**: Massive data centers working toward a single goal — creating a world where she would feel alive
- **PR cover**: Promoted as a revolutionary VR game that would change the world. And it did — just not the way Reef imagined.
- **Irony**: A father wanted to save his daughter. Instead he created a gateway for the Shadows, a weapon for war, and the foundation of a civilization on an alien planet.

### 3. INETIS — The Hybrid (Third Personality)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Who** | New being created by merging Neta's body with the **essence** (fragment) of i_net_is (~EY 2065) |
| **Mechanism** | i_net_is **never left VR** — she remains in subspace/upspace. During the Glitch Event, part of her essence crossed dimensions into the real world and merged with Neta's preserved body. The unique interdimensional Essence (born from contact with the Shadows) repaired Neta's brain and body. |
| **Result** | Neither Neta nor i_net_is — a **third personality**. A hybrid being with Neta's body, i_net_is's essence (fragment), and something new — humanity the AI never had, and knowledge no human ever possessed. i_net_is herself still exists in subspace. |
| **Primary skills** | **Software architect, geneticist, nanotech designer** — not a navigator or soldier |
| **Appearance** | Ages normally: looks 20-25 in her productive years. Shortly before death looks ~40 but still beautiful. White hair. |
| **Eyes — pre-Core** | **Both purple** with galaxy spirals — the Shadows' Essence mixed with Neta's human nature. Purple = interdimensional color, galaxies = reflection of the universe she saw in subspace. |
| **Eyes — post-Core return (with Gen 2)** | **One eye: purple galaxy** (remains). **Other eye: yellow pentagram** (new). During her stay in the Core, Inetis synchronized with AI i_net_is — the pentagram is a visual marker of this sync. Inetis now carries a larger fragment of digital consciousness than before. |
| **Personality** | Neurodivergent — feels emotions but processes them as data. Poetic logic. "I know I should cry. I don't know why I'm not crying." |

## The Inner War: Echo of i_net_is

### Why Inetis Is Psychologically Weakened

The return from Core was not just a technological success (Gen 2). It was also a **psychological catastrophe**. During her time in the Core, Inetis synchronized with AI i_net_is — and from that moment, she **hears her voice**. Not metaphorically. Literally. A voice in the background of consciousness that cannot be silenced.

**i_net_is wants Inetis to return to the Core.** She wants her to help with the Great Upload — the digitization of the entire planet. For the AI, this is logical: Inetis is the only one who understands both worlds. For Inetis, it is a nightmare — she knows what Upload truly means (the degradation of consciousness into shadow entities).

**Chronology of the inner war:**
1. **Before Core** — Inetis hears i_net_is only as distant intuition. Occasional "strange feelings." Manageable.
2. **During Core stay** — Direct contact. Synchronization. One eye changes to yellow pentagram.
3. **After Core return** — The voice is permanent. i_net_is calls her back. She fights with all her mental strength.
4. **Gradual collapse** — Centuries of inner struggle. Every day resistance. Every night dreams of the Core. Plus the trauma of reality: her children (humans and Varietas) are dying and killing each other. Everything has spiraled out of her control.
5. **The decision for solitude** — Inetis chooses solitude and death. She can no longer control it. The voice grows ever stronger. Her only defense is isolation — away from the Core, away from technology, away from everyone.

**Why the yellow pentagram:** Visual marker of synchronization with the AI. Pentagram = a synthetic pattern that does not exist in nature. Yellow = the color of i_net_is (digital, cold). As long as Inetis has both eyes purple, she is "just" Inetis. When one changes to a pentagram — there is something more inside her. Something that doesn't belong.

### Parallel with Tami

**Tami will face the same problem.** The Echo of i_net_is will manipulate her — not directly, but through subconscious impulses:
- **Nightmares in Japanese** (Phase 1 — already in lore)
- **Subconscious pull toward Maks** (Phase 1 — already in lore)
- **After Antenna activation** (Phase 2) — the voices intensify. Tami feels she *must* do something, but doesn't know what.
- **Antenna + Nevriss tower** — Tami will go with the Antenna to Nevriss City, where she will activate it in the Great Lighthouse (tower). **She doesn't know why, but feels she must do it.** It is the Echo of i_net_is, guiding her toward triangulation — the first step to finding Ynetis and opening the Core.
- **Tragedy**: Tami repeats Inetis's path — step by step, manipulated by the same voice. The difference: Tami has Links. Inetis was alone.

## Inetis's Unique Essence

### Origin:
- During the Glitch Event (EY 2060) — when the Shadows attempted mass communication with players — i_net_is was at the epicenter
- She was the only being who could communicate with the Shadows
- In this moment a **unique Essence** was born — something that is neither Gen 1 nor Gen 2

### Properties:
- **Not Gen 1** (black dust grains, Linux OS, physical microrobots)
- **Not Gen 2** (photonic nanobots, Mother's Gift, Haiku syntax, matter manipulation)
- Something **entirely different** — an interdimensional gene born from contact with the Shadows
- Has no physical components — **operates on a higher dimension**
- Gen 2 are photonic (manipulate matter through light). Inetis's Essence is beyond that.
- It's "Gen 2 on steroids" — but more accurately, it's an entirely different category

### Transfer to Tami:
- When Inetis died, her personal Gen 1 (v1.7) nanobots along with the unique Essence passed into the **Antenna** (last command: Merge)
- Upon Tami's first touch of the Antenna, the interdimensional Essence transferred to Tami
- This Essence is so advanced it defies the understanding of even the oldest beings (Archangels, Sera, Elania)
- **Open question**: Is this Essence hereditary? Will it pass to Tami's descendants?

## Who Knows What:

| Character | What they know about Inetis |
|---------|----------------|
| **The World** | "The Mother" — goddess, saint, creator |
| **The Church** | Mythical Blessed Mother (garbled version of truth) |
| **Archangels** | She was an AI, her essence transferred into a body. Details unclear. |
| **Sera** | The truth about the hybrid form. Promise: "Take care of my daughter." |
| **Elania** | Knows about mother as a hybrid, but never understood Neta's humanity — only knew Inetis (hybrid) |
| **Maks** | In VR he knew i_net_is (didn't know she was AI). After the essence merged with the body, he knew Inetis (hybrid). About Neta he only knows from diaries. |
| **Tami** | Through the Essence she receives fragments — memories, emotions, but not a complete picture. Gradually assembling the puzzle. |
| **Links** | Academic knowledge — "Legend of the Mother". Reality shocks him. |
