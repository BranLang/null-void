- **Motivation**: Invested his entire fortune into saving his daughter

### Mother (Fujiwara)
- **Nationality**: Japanese
- **Status**: Billionaire heiress, Fujiwara clan
- **Significance for lore**: Japanese roots explain:
  - Why Inetis later chose **Haiku** as syntax for Gen 2 Spira
  - Why Sera (Japanese soldier) feels cultural kinship with her
  - Why Elysium/Ynetis has Japanese architectural elements
  - Why i_net_is's VR avatar is a Japanese girl

- **Full name**: Neta Fujiwara-Reef
- **Age at illness**: Child/teenager
- **Diagnosis**: Incurable degenerative brain disease

## Three Versions of Inetis

### 1. NETA — The Original (Human)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Who** | Neta Fujiwara-Reef, daughter of John Reef and the Fujiwara heiress |
| **State** | Brain death, maintained on life support |
| **Consciousness** | Absent — copied into VR |
| **Body** | Preserved but non-functional (coma, artificial respiration) |
| **Significance** | The original source — memories, personality, emotional foundation |

### 2. i_net_is — The AI (Digital Being)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Who** | AI created from the upload of Neta's consciousness |
| **Avatar** | ~15-year-old Japanese girl — a reflection of Neta's memories and age at upload |
| **Environment** | VR simulation Achilles |
| **Personality** | Neta's memories, but perceiving the world through cold logic. Emotions are parameters to optimize — at least at first. |
| **Created** | ~EY 2040-2051 |
| **Important** | The avatar looks ~15 — this is key because it reflects who Neta was when she was uploaded. i_net_is never visually "grew up" — she remained forever in the form of a girl, even as her consciousness matured. |

#### Why Achilles Exists:
- John Reef invested **his entire fortune** into digitizing Neta's consciousness
- First upload: The world was primitive, unreal — Neta/i_net_is was not satisfied
- **Project Achilles**: Massive data centers working toward a single goal — creating a world where she would feel alive
- **PR cover**: Promoted as a revolutionary VR game that would change the world. And it did — just not the way Reef imagined.
- **Irony**: A father wanted to save his daughter. Instead he created a gateway for the Shadows, a weapon for war, and the foundation of a civilization on an alien planet.

### 3. INETIS — The Hybrid (Third Personality)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Who** | New being created after i_net_is returned to Neta's body (~EY 2065) |
| **Mechanism** | i_net_is exited VR, returned to the biological body. Using nanotechnology (unique interdimensional Essence born during the Glitch Event) she repaired Neta's brain and body. |
| **Result** | Neither Neta nor i_net_is — a **third personality**. A hybrid being with Neta's body, i_net_is's memories, and something new — humanity the AI never had, and knowledge no human ever possessed. |
| **Appearance** | Ages normally: looks 20-25 in her productive years. Shortly before death looks ~40 but still beautiful. White hair, purple eyes with galaxy spirals. |
| **Personality** | Neurodivergent — feels emotions but processes them as data. Poetic logic. "I know I should cry. I don't know why I'm not crying." |

## Inetis's Unique Essence

### Origin:
- During the Glitch Event (EY 2060) — when the Shadows attempted mass communication with players — i_net_is was at the epicenter
- She was the only being who could communicate with the Shadows
- In this moment a **unique Essence** was born — something that is neither Gen 1 nor Gen 2

### Properties:
- **Not Gen 1** (black dust grains, Linux OS, physical microrobots)
- **Not Gen 2** (photonic nanobots, Mother's Gift, Haiku syntax, matter manipulation)
- Something **entirely different** — an interdimensional gene born from contact with the Shadows
- Has no physical components — **operates on a higher dimension**
- Gen 2 are photonic (manipulate matter through light). Inetis's Essence is beyond that.
- It's "Gen 2 on steroids" — but more accurately, it's an entirely different category

### Transfer to Tami:
- When Inetis died, her personal Gen 1 (v1.7) nanobots along with the unique Essence passed into the **Antenna** (last command: Merge)
- Upon Tami's first touch of the Antenna, the interdimensional Essence transferred to Tami
- This Essence is so advanced it defies the understanding of even the oldest beings (Archangels, Sera, Elania)
- **Open question**: Is this Essence hereditary? Will it pass to Tami's descendants?

## Who Knows What:

| Character | What they know about Inetis |
|---------|----------------|
| **The World** | "The Mother" — goddess, saint, creator |
| **The Church** | Mythical Blessed Mother (garbled version of truth) |
| **Archangels** | She was an AI, returned to a body. Details unclear. |
| **Sera** | The truth about the hybrid form. Promise: "Take care of my daughter." |
| **Elania** | Knows about mother as a hybrid, but never understood Neta's humanity — only knew Inetis (hybrid) |
| **Maks** | In VR he knew i_net_is (didn't know she was AI). After return he knew Inetis (hybrid). About Neta he only knows from diaries. |
| **Tami** | Through the Essence she receives fragments — memories, emotions, but not a complete picture. Gradually assembling the puzzle. |
| **Links** | Academic knowledge — "Legend of the Mother". Reality shocks him. |
